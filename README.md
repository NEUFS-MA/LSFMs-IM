# LSFM-IM
A collection of papers and resources related to LSFMs in Intelligent Manufacturing Applications.

The organization of papers refers to our survey ["Large Scale Foundation Models for Intelligent Manufacturing Applications: A Survey"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06718)

The emergence of Large-Scale Foundational Models (LSFMs) has brought new opportunities to the field of intelligent manufacturing, shifting the paradigm from single-task, single-mode, limited data models based on deep learning to encompassing multiple tasks, multiple modes, and pre-training on large-scale datasets.
