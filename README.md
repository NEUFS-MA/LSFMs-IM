## The evolution from deep learning to LSFMs
The emergence of Large-Scale Foundational Models (LSFMs) has brought new opportunities to the field of intelligent manufacturing, shifting the paradigm from single-task, single-mode, limited data models based on deep learning to encompassing multiple tasks, multiple modes, and pre-training on large-scale datasets.

### Progresses and challenges of deep learning in intelligent manufacturing
Overfitting refers to the phenomenon where a model excessively adapts to the training dataset during the training process, resulting in the model performing well on the training data but having poor generalization ability for new data.

### Background for large scale doundation models
Foundation models were designed to be trained on large-scale datasets, i.e., with parameters over billions to hundreds of billions and were named for the first time recently [184].
