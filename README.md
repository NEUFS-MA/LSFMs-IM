## The evolution from deep learning to large scale foundation models(LSFMs)
Pioneering work of artificial neural network started around Dartmouth workshops in 1956 [201], and 1960s-1990s witnessed the development of machine learning when back propagation [202], Boltzmann machine [203],K-nearest neighbor [204],support vector machine [205], among many other classical machine learning methods were invented to solve classification and regression issues in various scientific and industrial areas.
