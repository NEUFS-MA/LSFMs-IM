## The evolution from deep learning to LSFMs
The emergence of large scale foundational models(LSFMs) had triggered a wave in the field of artificial intelligence, shifting deep learning models from single-task, single-modal, limited data patterns to a paradigm encompassing diverse tasks, multimodal, and pre-training on massive datasets.
