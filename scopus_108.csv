Language models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) that pre-trained on massive corpora, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its related downstream tasks. However, how to leverage these models for facilitating system fault diagnosis and verify its effectiveness is rarely explored. This paper incorporates the potential comprehension ability of pre-trained LLMs, and investigates the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for realizing efficient system fault diagnosis. The experiments conducted in this study involve both open-source and closed-source models, and utilize a simulation and a real fault diagnosis dataset. We find that these models consistently achieve high performance across various metrics compared to the baselines. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed to investigate several aspects of the approach, such as the impact of dataset size, data normalization, missing values and explainability of the diagnosis, further showcasing the potential as well as limitations of the approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",chemical plant; complex systems; fault diagnosis; high-speed train; large language model; prognosis and health management,Chemical plants; Computational linguistics; Fault detection; Natural language processing systems; Railroad cars; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Diagnosis of complex systems; Empirical studies; Faults diagnosis; Fine tuning; Health management; High speed trains; Language model; Large language model; Prognose and health management; System faults; Failure analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhu, Z., Lei, Y., Qi, G., A review of the application of deep learning in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery[J] (2023) Measurement, 206; Xu, J., Wang, R., Liang, Z., Physics-guided, data-refined fault root cause tracing framework for complex electromechanical system[J] (2023) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 236; Xiong, J., A fault diagnosis method for building electrical systems based on the combination of variational modal decomposition and new mutual dimensionless (2023) Scientific Reports, 13 (1), p. 4567; Li, Y.F., Wang, H., Sun, M., ChatGPT-Like Large-Scale Foundation Models for Prognostics and Health Management: A Survey and Roadmaps[J] (2023) Reliability Engineering & System Safety; Hu, Q., Si, X.S., Zhang, Q.H., A rotating machinery fault diagnosis method based on multi-scale dimensionless indicators and random forests[J] (2020) Mechanical systems and signal processing, 139; Liu, J., Hu, Y., Yang, S., A SVM-based framework for fault detection in high-speed trains[J] (2021) Measurement, 172; Li, S., Peng, Y., Shen, Y., Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Data Imbalance and Variable Speed Based on Adaptive Clustering Weighted Oversampling[J] (2024) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 244; Ahmed, S.F., Alam, M.S.B., Hassan, M., Deep learning modelling techniques: current progress, applications, advantages, and challenges (2023) Artif Intell Rev, 56, pp. 13521-13617; Zio, E., Prognostics and Health Management (PHM): Where are we and where do we (need to) go in theory and practice[J] (2022) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 218; Han, T., Tian, J., Chung, C.Y., Challenges and opportunities for battery health estimation: Bridging laboratory research and real-world applications[J] (2024) Journal of Energy Chemistry, 89, pp. 434-436; Zheng, S., Wang, C., Zio, E., Fault detection in complex mechatronic systems by a hierarchical graph convolution attention network based on causal paths[J] (2024) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 243; Meng, H., Geng, M., Han, T., Long short-term memory network with Bayesian optimization for health prognostics of lithium-ion batteries based on partial incremental capacity analysis[J] (2023) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 236; Yang, Z., Baraldi, P., Zio, E., A method for fault detection in multi-component systems based on sparse autoencoder-based deep neural networks[J] (2022) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 220; Pan, T., Chen, J., Zhang, T., Generative adversarial network in mechanical fault diagnosis under small sample: A systematic review on applications and future perspectives[J] (2022) ISA transactions, 128, pp. 1-10; Devlin, J., Chang, M.W., Lee, K., (2018), Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805; Brown, T., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Language models are few-shot learners[J] (2020) Advances in neural information processing systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901; Ray, P.P., ChatGPT: A comprehensive review on background, applications, key challenges, bias, ethics, limitations and future scope[J] (2023) Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems; Deng, X., Bashlovkina, V., Han, F., LLMs to the Moon?

This study explores the integration of domain knowledge accumulated in unstructured text data such as technical documents and maintenance logs into diagnostics models using LLMs. The study demonstrates the new possibilities to exploit data that are traditionally underutilized due to their complexity and the presence of domain-specific jargon. By leveraging LLMs for contextual understanding and information extraction from such texts, this study proposes a novel approach that combines textual data with existing condition monitoring systems to improve the accuracy of diagnostics models. A case study on hydrogenerators illustrates the feasibility and value of integrating LLMs into PHM systems. The findings suggest that the incorporation of LLMs can lead to more informed, accurate diagnostics, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and safety within industrial environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Expert knowledge; Fault detection and diagnostics; Large language model; Multimodal data; Technical language processing,Accident prevention; Computational linguistics; Condition monitoring; Data integration; Fault detection; Domain knowledge; Expert knowledge; Fault detection and diagnostics; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Multi-modal data; Technical language processing; Technical languages; Textual data; Domain Knowledge,,,,,"Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Tunis, ENIT","This work was funded by R\u00E9gion Occitanie, Communaut\u00E9 d\u2019Agglom\u00E9ration Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es , \u00C9cole Nationale d\u2019Ing\u00E9nieurs de Tarbes (ENIT) , and University of Technology Tarbes Occitanie Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es (UTTOP) .","This work was funded by R\u00E9gion Occitanie, Communaut\u00E9 d'Agglom\u00E9ration Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es, \u00C9cole Nationale d'Ing\u00E9nieurs de Tarbes (ENIT), and University of Technology Tarbes Occitanie Pyr\u00E9n\u00E9es (UTTOP), France.",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, P.W., More is different: Broken symmetry and the nature of the hierarchical structure of science.

Equipment in industrial scenarios often operates in normal conditions, resulting in missing anomalies, limited failures, and incomplete degradation paths. Thus the limited information on the state of the equipment collected from sensor readings severely hinders the cognitive capabilities of discriminative artificial intelligence (AI) for PHM. Data augmentation and generation (DA&G) techniques, represented by generative AI, have shown great promise in overcoming the limitations of PHM application scenarios. Research on DA&G has yielded significant achievements, but a comprehensive review in the mechanical field is still lacking. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA&G techniques aimed at solving the DDP problems, which are divided into three categories insights of data, mechanism, and features. The data-based randomized approach applies controlled randomness for augmentation. The mechanism-based domain-specific techniques advocate for exploring relationships between the physical entity and monitoring data for generating by reasoned inference. The feature-based generative model aims to identify the latent space of data and subsequently resample it. Finally, the paper explores strategies for evaluating DA&G and provides a deep insight into the challenges and opportunities of DA&G techniques. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Data augmentation; Data generation; Fault diagnosis; Generative artificial intelligence; Prognostics and health management,Artificial intelligence; Fault detection; Augmentation techniques; Data augmentation; Data generation; Fault prognostics; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Generation techniques; Generative artificial intelligence; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Prognostic and health management; Failure analysis,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 52275129; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi: AA23062031; Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi; Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province: 2022LL-JB-19; Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province; 2024JC-TBZC-08; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: XZY022024089, XZY022023062; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors would like to sincerely thank all the anonymous reviewers for the valuable comments that greatly helped to improve the manuscript.

Extracting crucial information related to catalysts from domain literature can help scientists find new and effective electrocatalysts. Herein, we used various advanced machine learning, natural language processing techniques and large language models (LLMs) approaches to extract relevant information about the CO2 electrocatalytic reduction process from scientific literature. By applying the extraction pipeline, we present an open-source corpus for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The database contains two types of corpus: (1) the benchmark corpus, which is a collection of 6,985 records extracted from 1,081 publications by catalysis postgraduates; and (2) the extended corpus, which consists of content extracted from 5,941 documents using traditional NLP techniques and LLMs techniques. The Extended Corpus I and II contain 77,016 and 30,283 records, respectively. Furthermore, several domain literature fine-tuned LLMs were developed. Overall, this work will contribute to the exploration of new and effective electrocatalysts by leveraging information from domain literature using cutting-edge computer techniques. © The Author(s) 2024.",,"carbon dioxide; factual database; language; machine learning; natural language processing; Carbon Dioxide; Databases, Factual; Language; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide",,,"Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS; Beijing Association for Science and Technology, BAST: BYESS2023410; Beijing Association for Science and Technology, BAST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2022YFF0712200, 2021YFA1202802, 2022YFF0711900; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: T2322027; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan of China under Grant No. 2022YFF0712200, 2022YFF0711900 and 2021YFA1202802, the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. T2322027, Information Science Database in National Basic Science Data Center under Grant No.NBSDC-DB-25, the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by Beijing Association for Science and Technology (BYESS2023410), the CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS.",,,,,,,,,,"Birdja, Y.Y., Advances and challenges in understanding the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to fuels (2019) Nat.

The proposed architecture uses the strengths of both centralized and decentralized learning approaches, combining the broad knowledge capture of foundation models with the privacy-preserving and adaptive nature of federated learning. Through extensive simulations on a representative aircraft fleet, the integrated FM + FL approach demonstrated consistently superior performance compared to standalone implementations across multiple key metrics, including prediction accuracy, model size efficiency, and convergence speed. The framework establishes a robust digital twin ecosystem for real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and fleet-wide optimization. Comparative analysis reveals significant improvements in anomaly detection capabilities and reduced false alarm rates compared to traditional methods. The study conducts a systematic evaluation of the benefits and limitations of FM, FL, and integrated approaches in AHMS, examining their implications for system robustness, scalability, and security. Statistical analysis confirms that the integrated approach substantially enhances precision and recall in identifying potential failures while optimizing computational resources and training time. This paper outlines a detailed aviation ecosystem architecture integrating these advanced AI technologies across centralized processing, client, and communication domains. Future research directions are identified, focusing on improving model efficiency, ensuring generalization across diverse operational conditions, and addressing regulatory and ethical considerations. © 2024 by the author.",aircraft safety; Artificial Intelligence of Things; aviation health monitoring systems; cognitive computing; federated learning; foundation models; machine learning in aviation; predictive maintenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bommasani, R., Hudson, D.A., Adeli, E., Altman, R., Arora, S., von Arx, S., Bernstein, M.S., Brunskill, E., (2021) On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models, , https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258, Available online; Li, X., Tian, Y., Ye, P., Duan, H., Wang, F.Y., A novel scenarios engineering methodology for foundation models in metaverse (2022) IEEE Trans.

Due to assembly instructions including numerous contents, and the content being easy for workers to understand, process designers need to spend lots of time thinking and authoring assembly instructions to ensure that workers can complete the assembly task according to the assembly instructions. Focusing on the difficulties of the variety of assembly instructions and the process factors implicit in the standard languages of assembly instructions, a method of assembly instruction generation for helicopter subassemblies is proposed. First, a data representation model of multi-source heterogeneous knowledge and information based on knowledge graphs is designed and established. Then, a hierarchical pruning VF3 algorithm is presented to reuse assembly instructions according to hybrid similarity. Finally, a process factor revision model based on RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF is proposed to generate revised assembly instructions. Helicopter subassemblies, which contain 11,240 assembly procedures, are used to evaluate the performance of the method for generating assembly instructions. The proposed method greatly reduces the time cost of assembly instruction authoring and promotes the intelligent development of assembly process design. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Assembly instruction generation; Helicopter subassembly assembly; Knowledge graph; Large language model; Subgraph matching,Assembly; Fixtures (tooling); Modeling languages; Process design; Teaching; Assembly instruction generation; Assembly instructions; Helicopter subassembly assembly; Instruction generations; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Process factor; Subgraph matching; Workers'; Knowledge graph,,,,,Aeronautical Science Foundation of China: 2023M043052001; Aeronautical Science Foundation of China,This work is supported by the Aeronautical Science Foundation of China 2023M043052001.,,,,,,,,,,"Mo, J., Cai, J., Zhang, Z., Lu, Z., DFA-oriented assembly relation modeling (1999) Int.

By leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research aims to understand the impact of DIAs on assembly processes, emphasizing human-centric design and operational efficiency. The study is novel in considering the three primary objectives: evaluating the technical robustness of DIAs, assessing their effect on operators' cognitive workload and user experience, and determining the overall performance improvement of the assembly process. Methodologically, the research employs a laboratory experiment, incorporating a controlled setting to meticulously assess the DIA's performance. The experiment used a between-subjects design comparing a group of participants using the DIA against a control group relying on traditional manual methods across a series of assembly tasks. Findings reveal a significant enhancement in the operators' experience, a reduction in cognitive load, and an improvement in the quality of process outputs when the DIA is employed. The article contributes to the study of the DIA's potential and AI integration in manufacturing, offering insights into the design, development, and evaluation of DIAs in industrial settings. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Experimental design; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0; Natural language processing,Assembly; Design of experiments; Industry 4.0; Natural language processing systems; Assembly process; Chatbots; Cognitive workloads; Industry 5.0; Intelligent assistants; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Computational linguistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bangor, A., Kortum, P.T., Miller, J.T., An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale (2008) Int J.

While, with the emergence of advanced data-driven and digital twin technologies, the Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM), which corrects, predicts, and prevents product defects based on multi-sources of data, is of great significance in improving assembly quality. As the specific application for the utilization of ZDM in product assembly, the critical performance index of the assembly results is predicted by taking into account the multi-source factors such as geometric deviation of the parts, material properties, assembly sequences and process boundary conditions during assembly. In this paper, we address the high computational cost and low computational efficiency of numerical simulation methods under multi-source factors, and propose a data-driven approach named DTA-VIT based on the fusion of heterogeneous variables for digital twin assembly modeling of products. Firstly, the geometric and performance variables of the assembly process are analyzed and modelled. Secondly, a multi-source assembly data fusion network under the Vision Transformer framework is developed. This network takes the parameter space, which fuses multi-source variables from the assembly process as input and the assembly result as output. Finally, a case study of the assembly process of composite bolted joint structures in aircraft assembly is conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. The methodology provides a solid foundation for subsequent assembly quality control and prevent by predicting assembly performance efficiently, ultimately enabling the production of high-quality products. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Assembly quality; Deep learning model; Digital twin-based assembly; Feature fusion; Multi-source assembly factors,Assembly machines; Process control; Quality of service; Assembly model; Assembly process; Assembly quality; Deep learning model; Digital twin-based assembly; Features fusions; Learning models; Multi-source assembly factor; Multi-Sources; Zero defects; Data fusion,,,,,"Center for High Performance Computing, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU HPC; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2019YFA0709001, 2022YFF0605700; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51975349","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant No. 2019YFA0709001], the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant No.2022YFF0605700] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 51975349].

Robotic cooperative behaviors and 3D assembly operations in collaborative industrial environments require ambient environment monitoring and geospatial simulation tools, computer vision and spatial mapping algorithms, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) planning software. Flexible industrial and cloud computing environments necessitate sensing and actuation capabilities, cognitive data visualization and sensor fusion tools, and image recognition and computer vision technologies so as to lead to tangible business outcomes. Purpose of the article: We show that generative AI and cyber–physical manufacturing sys-tems, fog and edge computing tools, and task scheduling and computer vision algorithms are instrumental in the interactive economics of industrial metaverse. Generative AI-based digital twin industrial metaverse develops on IoRT and production management systems, multi-sensory extended reality and simulation modeling technologies, and machine and deep learning algorithms for big data-driven decision-making and image recognition processes. Virtual simulation modeling and deep reinforcement learning tools, autonomous manufacturing and virtual equipment systems, and deep learning-based object detection and spatial computing technologies can be leveraged in networked immersive environments for industrial big data processing. Methods: Evidence appraisal checklists and citation management software deployed for justifying inclusion or exclusion reasons and data collection and analysis comprise: Abstrackr, Colandr, Covidence, EPPI Reviewer, JBI-SUMARI, Rayyan, RobotReviewer, SR Accelerator, and Systematic Review Toolbox. Findings & value added: Modal actuators and sensors, robot trajectory planning and computational intelligence tools, and generative AI and cyber–physical manufacturing systems enable scalable data computation processes in smart virtual environments. Ambient intelligence and remote big data management tools, cloud-based robotic cooperation and industrial cyber-physical systems, and environment mapping and spatial computing algorithms improve IoT-based real-time production logistics and cooperative multi-agent controls in smart networked factories. Context recognition and data acquisition tools, generative AI and cyber– physical manufacturing systems, and deep and machine learning algorithms shape smart factories in relation to virtual path lines, collision-free motion planning, and coordinated and unpredictable smart manufacturing and robotic perception tasks, increasing economic per-formance.

Thus, effectively integrating various production modules is crucial to enable collaborative operations throughout the entire production chain, reducing management costs and complexities. This paper proposes, for the first time, the integration of Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies in the steel manufacturing domain, creating a novel steelmaking process management system. The system facilitates data collection, analysis, visualization, and intelligent dialogue for the steelmaking process. The VLM module provides textual descriptions for slab defect detection, while LLM technology supports the analysis of production data and intelligent question-answering. The feasibility, superiority, and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated through production data and comparative experiments.

Therefore, monitoring bearing failures in production equipment is important for improving supply chain sustainability. Due to the generalization limitations of neural network models, specific models must be trained for specific tasks. However, in real industrial scenarios, there is a severe lack of labeled samples, making it difficult to deploy fault diagnosis models across massive amounts of equipment in workshops. In order to solve the above issue, this paper proposes a cloud-edge-end collaborative semi-supervised learning framework, which provides multi-level computing power and data support for building a foundation model. A data augmentation method based on the bearing fault mechanism is proposed, which effectively preserves the inherent essential characteristics in vibration signals by normalizing frequency and adding noise in specific frequency bands. A novel contrastive learning model is designed, which narrows the distances between positive samples and widens the distances between negative samples in the high-dimensional space through cross comparisons in the time dimension and knowledge dimension, thereby extracting the most essential characteristics from the unlabeled signals. Multiple sets of experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an approximately 98% fault classification accuracy with only 1.2% labeled samples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Cloud-edge-end collaboration; Contrastive learning; Fault diagnosis; Foundation model; Semi-supervised learning,Classification (of information); Domain Knowledge; Fault detection; Machine learning; Supply chains; Bearing failures; Bearing fault diagnosis; Cloud-edge-end collaboration; Contrastive learning; Domain knowledge; Essential characteristic; Faults diagnosis; Foundation models; Production equipments; Semi-supervised learning; Failure analysis,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62103046, 72192844, 72201266, 72192843; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2021YFB1715700; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 2023CX01020, E1E40805X2; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021YFB1715700; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62103046, 72201266, 72192843, and 72192844; in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant E1E40805X2 and 2023CX01020.",,,,,,,,,,"Chang, C., Peng, W.-C., Chen, T.-F., LLM4TS: Two-stage fine-tuning for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs (2023); Chen, T., Kornblith, S., Norouzi, M., Hinton, G., A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations (2020) Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1597-1607. , PMLR; Eldele, E., Ragab, M., Chen, Z., Wu, M., Kwoh, C.-K., Li, X., Guan, C., Self-supervised contrastive representation learning for semi-supervised time-series classification (2023) IEEE Trans.

Aimed at overcoming the limitations of conventional training methods in metal additive manufacturing (AM), our system integrates AR to provide an immersive learning environment, enhancing the real-world experience with interactive digital overlays. The core of the system lies in its use of VLM, which, pre-trained on diverse datasets, excels in processing multi-modal data, thereby offering nuanced and contextually relevant guidance for trainees. Key experiments demonstrate the system's effectiveness, particularly highlighting the usage of VLM as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent to integrate external tools like YOLO-v7 for valve state classification and CRAFT for control panel text recognition. This approach significantly improves recognition accuracy, operational understanding, and human–machine interaction, especially for non-expert users, making complex metal AM operations more accessible. The research not only showcases the potential of AR and VLM in industrial training but also sets a new standard for smart manufacturing practices, indicating broader applications in various industrial domains. © 2024 The Author(s)",Augmented reality; Digital twins; Metal additive manufacturing; Non-expert training; Vision language model,3D printing; Additives; Augmented reality; Computational linguistics; Computer aided instruction; Computer aided language translation; Data handling; Industrial research; Immersive augmented realities; Immersive learning; Language model; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Non-expert training; Renishaw; Training methods; Training Systems; Vision language model; E-learning,,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; University of California, San Diego, UCSD; 80NSSC22M0132; MCS1292-20-01; FA9550-16-1-0507","This work was mainly funded by the MUREP High Volume project (80NSSC22M0132) through the U.S. NASA\u2019s Office of STEM Engagement, and Defense Manufacturing Community Support Program (DMCSP) project (MCS1292-20-01) through the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation .

This necessitates collaborative robots with advanced natural interaction capabilities and improved perception, cognition, and action intelligence. The Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits strong reasoning abilities and generalization capabilities, which can significantly advance the development of HSM once integrated into human–robot interaction and collaboration. Accordingly, this paper explores part of LLM's ability in the context of smart manufacturing, focusing on addressing interruptions in the manufacturing process caused by repetitive tool fetching. To alleviate this issue, a vision and language cobot navigation approach is innovatively adopted in the manufacturing environment that could be further used to assist operators in retrieving tools. Specifically, a real Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) manufacturing scene is first reconstructed and annotated using Three-Dimensional (3D) point cloud techniques. Then the LLM is utilized for the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) to comprehend natural language commands and generate Python code to triger navigation actions. Finally, the Pathfinder algorithm is applied for corresponding path planning. The framework is implemented in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Habitat simulator, and the case studies demonstrate that the AGV can accurately comprehend complex language instructions, empowering human operators to complete manufacturing tasks efficiently. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Human-centric smart manufacturing;

Without a doubt, the emergence of SAM will yield significant benefits for a wide array of practical image segmentation applications. In this study, we conduct a series of intriguing investigations into the performance of SAM across various applications, particularly in the fields of natural images, agriculture, manufacturing, remote sensing and healthcare. We analyze and discuss the benefits and limitations of SAM, while also presenting an outlook on its future development in segmentation tasks. By doing so, we aim to give a comprehensive understanding of SAM’s practical applications. This work is expected to provide insights that facilitate future research activities toward generic segmentation.

However, the intricate domain knowledge and the unique software paradigms inherent to the manufacturing sector have posed significant barriers to the effective utilization of LLM. To address this divide, an error-assisted fine-tuning approach is proposed to adapt LLM specifically for the manufacturing domain. Initially, the LLM is fine-tuned using a manufacturing-domain corpus, allowing it to learn and adapt to the nuances of the manufacturing field. Additionally, the injection of a labeled dataset into a pre-configured LLM enhances its ability to identify key elements within the domain. To ensure the generation of syntactically valid programs in domain-specific languages, and to accommodate environmental constraints, an error-assisted iterative prompting procedure is introduced, which facilitates the generation of reliable and expected code. Experimental results demonstrate the model's proficiency in accurately responding to manufacturing-related queries and its effectiveness in generating reliable code, where the accuracy of judgment querying can experience an improvement of approximately 4.1%. By expanding the applicability of LLM to the manufacturing industry, it is hoped that this research will pave the way for a broad array of new LLM-based applications within manufacturing. © 2024",Generative AI; Industry 4.0; Knowledge management; Large language model; Smart manufacturing,Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Errors; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Problem oriented languages; Domain knowledge; Fine tuning; Generative AI; Language model; Large language model; Manufacturing domains; Manufacturing excellence; Manufacturing sector; Smart manufacturing; Software paradigm; Knowledge management,,,,,"2020YFE020182; 22010500900; 1-BBR2; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; Innovation and Technology Commission, ITC; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","This research is partially funded by the Mainland–Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme ( MHX/001/20 ), Shanghai Science and Technology Program under Grant ( 22010500900 ), Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC), Hong Kong Special Administration Region , National Key R&D Programs of Cooperation on Science and Technology Innovation with Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan ( 2020YFE020182 ), Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the People’s Republic of China , and State Key Laboratory of Ultra-Precision Machining Technology (Project No. 1-BBR2 ), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKSAR, China .",,,,,,,,,,"Wang, X., Anwer, N., Dai, Y., Liu, A., ChatGPT for design, manufacturing, and education (2023) Proc.

However, great disparity exists between academic approaches and industrial practice to anomaly detection. Industry predominantly uses simple, efficient methods due to better interpretability and ease of implementation. In contrast, academically favor deep-learning methods, despite their advanced capabilities, face practical challenges in real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MonitorAssistant, an end-to-end practical anomaly detection system via Large Language Models. MonitorAssistant automates model configuration recommendation achieving knowledge inheritance and alarm interpretation with guidance-oriented anomaly reports, facilitating a more intuitive engineer-system interaction through natural language. By deploying MonitorAssistant in Microsoft’s cloud service system, we validate its efficacy and practicality, marking a significant advancement in the field of practical anomaly detection for large-scale cloud services. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Anomaly Detection; Cloud Service Monitoring; Large Language Models; Software Reliability,Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Distributed database systems; Learning systems; Software reliability; Web services; Anomaly detection; Cloud service monitoring; Cloud services; Language model; Large language model; Large-scales; Service monitoring; Service systems; Software-Reliability; System monitoring; Anomaly detection,,,,,"Beijing National Research Center For Information Science And Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62072264; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072264, and the Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist) key projects.

(Formula presented.) forecasting on the entire industrial region throughout mainland China is an important application of heterogeneous networks, which has great significance to factory management and human health travel. In recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notability in terms of time series prediction. However, existing LLMs tend to forecast nationwide industry (Formula presented.), which encounters two issues. First, most LLM-based models use centralized training, which requires uploading large amounts of data from sensors to a central cloud. This entire transmission process can lead to security risks of data leakage. Second, LLMs fail to extract spatiotemporal correlations in the nationwide sensor network (heterogeneous network). To tackle these issues, we present a novel framework entitled Spatio-Temporal Large Language Model with Edge Computing Servers (STLLM-ECS) to securely predict nationwide industry (Formula presented.) in China. In particular, We initially partition the entire sensor network, located in the national industrial region, into several subgraphs. Each subgraph is allocated an edge computing server (ECS) for training and inference, avoiding the security risks caused by data transmission. Additionally, a novel LLM-based approach named Spatio-Temporal Large Language Model (STLLM) is developed to extract spatiotemporal correlations and infer prediction sequences. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposed model. © 2024 by the authors.",edge computing; heterogeneous network; LLM; secure forecasting nationwide industry PM2.5; security risks of data leakage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Liu, Y., Wang, K., Lin, Y., Xu, W., LightChain: A lightweight blockchain system for industrial internet of things (2019) IEEE Trans.

However, current intelligent process planning systems, like computer-aided process planning (CAPP), still contend with the challenge of realizing comprehensive automation in process decision-making. These obstacles chiefly involve, though are not confined to, issues like limited intelligence, poor flexibility, low reliability, and high usage thresholds. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has attained noteworthy accomplishments in natural language processing (NLP), offering new perspectives to address these challenges. This paper summarizes the limitations of current intelligent process planning methods and explores the potential of integrating generative AI into process planning. With synergistically incorporating digital twin (DT), this paper introduces a conceptual framework termed generative AI and DT-enabling intelligent process planning (GIPP). The paper elaborates on two supporting methodologies: process generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) modelling and DT-based process verification method. Moreover, a prototype system is established to introduce the implementation and machining execution mechanism of GIPP for milling a specific thin-walled component. Three potential application scenarios and a comparative analysis are employed to elucidate the practicality of GIPP, providing new insights for intelligent process planning. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",CAPP;

S.a.s., Lazio, Rome, Italy","Preliminary security risk analysis (PSRA) provides a quick approach to identify, evaluate, and propose remediation to potential risks in specific scenarios. The extensive expertise required for an effective PSRA and the substantial textual-related tasks hinders quick assessments in mission-critical contexts, where timely and prompt actions are essential. The speed and accuracy of human experts in PSRA significantly impact response time. A large language model can quickly summarise information in less time than a human. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored the capabilities of fine-tuned models (FTM) in PSRA. Our case study investigates the proficiency of FTM in assisting practitioners in PSRA. We manually curated 141 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the proficiency of the FTM versus seven human experts. Within the industrial context, our approach has proven successful in reducing errors in PSRA, hastening security risk detection, and minimizing false positives and negatives. This translates to cost savings for the company by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures. Therefore, experts can focus on more comprehensive risk analysis, leveraging LLMs for an effective preliminary assessment within a condensed timeframe. © 2024 ACM.",Analysis; Fine-Tuning; Generative AI; Human Experts; Large Language Model; LLM; Management; Preliminary; Risk; Security; Standards,Computational linguistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Analyse; Fine tuning; Generative AI; Human expert; Language model; Large language model; LLM; Preliminary; Security; Security risk analysis; Risk analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Basili, V.R., Caldiera, G., Rombach, H.D., The Goal Question Metric Approach (1994) Encyclopedia of Software Engineering, , 1994; Chang, Y., Wang, X., Wang, J., Wu, Y., Yang, L., Zhu, K., Chen, H., Xie, X., (2023) A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models, , [cs.

LLMs expedite code generation, verification, and bug-fixing tasks across software and hardware domains. Development of hardware designs typically involves translating natural language specifications into Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog or SystemVerilog, followed by circuit synthesis, physical layout, and fabrication, with the potential for human errors in the process. In the current industry practice, HDL verification tasks typically rely on manual expertise from security professionals to detect and address vulnerabilities. Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs integrate several Intellectual Property (IP) blocks implemented using HDL and communicate through a common bus to perform intended functions. Ensuring security throughout the SoC design process requires innovative solutions due to the complex nature of SoC designs and the distribution of assets across multiple IP blocks. Popular conversation LLMs such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's GEMINI (formerly BARD) offer the potential to automate HDL code generation and verification tasks by interpreting user prompts represented in natural language descriptions, thereby minimizing manual effort and enhancing hardware design quality. This paper explores recent research works on HDL generation, verification, and bug fix leveraging LLMs while addressing prevailing challenges and presenting potential opportunities for improvement. © 2024 ACM.",Bug Fix;

This study proposes a knowledge-enhanced joint model that incorporates aviation assembly knowledge graph (KG) embedding into large language models (LLMs). This model utilizes graph-structured Big Data within KGs to conduct prefix-tuning of the LLMs. The KGs for prefix-tuning enable an online reconfiguration of the LLMs, which avoids a massive computational load. Through the subgraph embedding learning process, the specialized knowledge of the joint model within the aviation assembly domain, especially in fault localization, is strengthened. In the context of aviation assembly functional testing, the joint model can generate knowledge subgraphs, fuse knowledge through retrieval augmentation, and ultimately provide knowledge-based reasoning responses. In practical industrial scenario experiments, the joint enhancement model demonstrates an accuracy of 98.5% for fault diagnosis and troubleshooting schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Data-driven; fault localization; intelligent fault diagnosis; knowledge graph (KG); large language model (LLM),Big data; Computational linguistics; Fault detection; Hidden Markov models; Job analysis; Knowledge graph; Cognition; Data driven; Fault localization; Faults diagnosis; Hidden-Markov models; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Task analysis; Failure analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tao, B., Zhao, X., Ding, H., Mobile-robotic machining for large complex components: A review study (2019) Sci.

Intelligent agent-driven digital twin systems excel in analysis, decision-making, and control, making them highly suitable for manufacturing resource scheduling, diagnostic decision-making, and other requirements. However, current intelligent agents have notable deficiencies in adaptability, data utilization, and interpretability. This limitation undermines decision security and acceptability, creating barriers for user intervention. Therefore, this paper introduces a DT multi agent architecture driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Agents perceive the characteristics of physical systems, particularly their temporal characteristics, by integrating data from various modalities. Multiple agents achieve insights through specific interaction mechanisms, while maintaining traceability. To showcase the advantages and characteristics of this architecture, we developed a typical application scenario for equipment maintenance. The effectiveness of each framework component was validated through ablation experiments. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework holds promising and extensive application prospects. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Digital Twin; Large Language Model (LLM); Multi-Agent Systems (MAS),Computational linguistics; Decision making; E-learning; Intelligent agents; Decision control; Decisions makings; Efficient technology; Excel; Feature learning; Language model; Large language model; Multi-agent system; Physical interactions; Temporal features; Multi agent systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Liu, S., Lu, Y., Li, J., Shen, X., Sun, X., Bao, J., A blockchain-based interactive approach between digital twin-based manufacturing systems (2023) Comput Ind Eng, 175; Bi, Z., Zhang, C.W.J., Wu, C., Li, L., New digital triad (DT-II) concept for lifecycle information integration of sustainable manufacturing systems (2022) J Ind Inf Integr, 26; Tomko, M., Winter, S., Beyond digital twins – A commentary (2019) Environ Plan B Urban Anal City Sci, 46, pp. 395-399; Errandonea, I., Beltrán, S., Arrizabalaga, S., Digital Twin for maintenance: a literature review (2020) Comput Ind, 123; Deloitte, Manufacturing is even more powerful: industry 4.0 and digital twins (2018) Softw Integr Circuit, 406, pp. 42-49; Nie, Q., Tang, D., Liu, C., Wang, L., Song, J., A multi-agent and cloud-edge orchestration framework of digital twin for distributed production control (2023) Robot Comput Integr Manuf, 82; Xia, K., Sacco, C., Kirkpatrick, M., Saidy, C., Nguyen, L., Kircaliali, A., A digital twin to train deep reinforcement learning agent for smart manufacturing plants: environment, interfaces and intelligence (2021) J Manuf Syst, 58, pp. 210-230; Brown, T.B., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J., Dhariwal, P., Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (2020) Adv Neural Inf Process Syst 2020; Vaswani, A., Brain, G., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Attention is all you need (2017) Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, p. 30; https://openreview.net/forum?id=zIJFG7wW2d, Agent Instructs Large Language Models to be General Zero-Shot Reasoners | OpenReview n.d.

This allows for preventing system failure. The latter may result in catastrophic outcomes (e.g., loss of lives). ACs support the certification of systems in compliance with industrial standards, e.g., DO-178C and ISO 26262. Identifying defeaters - -arguments that challenge these ACs - - is crucial for enhancing ACs' robustness and confidence. To automatically support that task, we propose a novel approach that explores the potential of GPT-4 Turbo, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, in identifying defeaters within ACs formalized using the Eliminative Argumentation (EA) notation. Our preliminary evaluation assesses the model's ability to comprehend and generate arguments in this context and the results show that GPT-4 turbo is very proficient in EA notation and can generate different types of defeaters. © 2024 is held by the owner/author(s).

In those settings, there are iterative activities that reduce the speed of SafetyOps cycles. One of these activities is ""Hazard Analysis Risk Assessment""(HARA), which is an essential step to start the safety requirements specification. As a potential approach to increase the speed of this step in SafetyOps, we have delved into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our objective is to systematically assess their potential for application in the field of safety engineering. To that end, we propose a framework to support a higher degree of automation of HARA with LLMs. Despite our endeavors to automate as much of the process as possible, expert review remains crucial to ensure the validity and correctness of the analysis results, with necessary modifications made accordingly. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

The pertinent issues primarily relate to the absence of execution guarantees for generated code, a lack of explainability, and suboptimal support for essential but niche programming languages. State-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 and LLaMa2 fail to produce valid programs for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) operated by Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). We propose LLM4PLC, a user-guided iterative pipeline leveraging user feedback and external verification tools - including grammar checkers, compilers and SMV verifiers - to guide the LLM's generation. We further enhance the generation potential of LLM by employing Prompt Engineering and model fine-tuning through the creation and usage of LoRAs. We validate this system using a FischerTechnik Manufacturing TestBed (MFTB), illustrating how LLMs can evolve from generating structurally-flawed code to producing verifiably correct programs for industrial applications. We run a complete test suite on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama-7B, a fine-tuned Code Llama-7B model, Code Llama-34B, and a fine-tuned Code Llama-34B model. The proposed pipeline improved the generation success rate from 47% to 72%, and the Survey-of-Experts code quality from 2.25/10 to 7.75/10.To promote open research, we share the complete experimental setup, the LLM Fine-Tuning Weights, and the video demonstrations of the different programs on our dedicated webpage1 © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

Digitalization offers technologies for data-driven decision-making, but many maintenance decisions still lack a factual basis. Prioritizing efficiency and effectiveness require analyzing equipment history, facilitated by using Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). However, CMMS data often contains unstructured free-text, leading to manual analysis, which is resource-intensive and reactive, focusing on short time periods and specific equipment. Two approaches are available to solve the issue: minimizing free-text entries or using advanced methods for processing them. Free-text allows detailed descriptions but may lack completeness, while structured reporting aids automated analysis but may limit fault description richness. As knowledge and experience are vital assets for companies this research uses a hybrid approach by combining Natural Language Processing with domain specific ontology and Large Language Models to extract information from free-text entries, enabling the possibility of real-time analysis e.g., identifying recurring failure and knowledge sharing across global sites. © 2024 The Authors.",Artificial Intelligence; Experience Reuse; Industrial Maintenance; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing,Computational linguistics; Decision making; Failure (mechanical); Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Computerized maintenance management system; Experience reuse; Free texts; Industrial maintenance; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Text entry; Maintenance,,,,,VINNOVA: 2019-05589,This work was supported by the Adapt 2030 project (Adaptive lifecycle design by applying digitalization and AI techniques to production) under Vinnova (Sweden's innovation agency) project grant 2019-05589 within the strategic innovation programme for Production2030 as well as part of the XPRES framework at M\u00E4lardalen University.,,,,,,,,,,"Franciosi, C., Voisin, A., Miranda, S., Riemma, S., Iung, B., Measuring maintenance impacts on sustainability of manufacturing industries: from a systematic literature review to a framework proposal (2020) Journal of Cleaner Production, 260, p. 121065; Pires, A., Martinho, G., Waste hierarchy index for circular economy in waste management (2019) Waste Management, 95, pp. 298-305; Geng, Y., Sarkis, J., Bleischwitz, R., How to build a circular economy for rare-earth elements (2023) Nature, 619, pp. 248-251; Bengtsson, M., Lundström, G., On the importance of combining “the new” with “the old” – One important prerequisite for maintenance in Industry 4.0 (2018) Procedia Manufacturing, 25, pp. 118-125; Kans, M., Campos, J., Salonen, A., Bengtsson, M., The Thinking Industry – An Approach for Gaining Highest Advantage of Digitalisation within Maintenance (2017) Journal of Maintenance Engineering, 2, pp. 147-158; Rahman, H., D’Cruze, R.S., Ahmed, M.U., Sohlberg, R., Sakao, T., Funk, P., Artificial Intelligence-Based Life Cycle Engineering in Industrial Production: A Systematic Literature Review (2022) IEEE Access, 10, pp. 133001-133015; Gopalakrishnan, M., (2018) Data-driven decision support for maintenance prioritisation – Connecting maintenance to productivity, , PhD diss., Chalmers University of Technology Sweden: Department of Industrial and Materials Science; Chirumalla, K., Bengtsson, M., Söderlund, C., Experience Reuse in Production Maintenance: Practices and Challenges (2015) Proceedings of 22nd European Operation Management Association Conference, EurOMA; Salonen, A., Bengtsson, M., Fridholm, V., The possibilities of improving maintenance through CMMS data analysis (2020) Proceedings of SPS2020, pp. 249-260. , Säfsten K, Elgh, F, editors.

Traditional methods of VoC extraction have typically fallen short in capturing the richness and nuance of customer sentiment. Contemporary machine learning (ML) approaches, while improved, still struggle to interpret the contextual subtleties of digital customer communications effectively. This study showcases the innovative deployment of GPT-3.5 Turbo, demonstrating its superior performance in extracting VoC through a deeper understanding of conversational context and a more intuitive, chat-based data processing. Furthermore, the large-scale, multilingual processing capabilities of this model offer a more comprehensive and inclusive analysis of VoC. The study ties these advancements to Lean Six Sigma 4.0, illustrating how the integration of GPT-3.5 Turbo’s transformative capabilities can elevate the customer-centric approach of Lean Six Sigma in the era of Industry 4.0. This innovative exploration points to a significant evolution in VoC analysis, offering potential for more insightful, real-time data–driven customer service strategies and a more substantial foundation for decision-making in product development and process improvement.

The system dynamically leverages abundant external knowledge and enhances the model's reasoning ability and interpretability through knowledge graphs. In response to five categories of issues in engineering management, experiments and in-depth analysis revealed that although large language models may lack granularity in addressing some complex problems, the question-answering system overall achieved intelligent assistance, improving the efficiency of collaborative engineering management. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This paper introduces a novel approach for sensor data gathering and retrieval. The proposal leverages large language models to convert sensor data into FAIR-compliant formats and to provide word embedding representations of tabular data for subsequent exploration, enabling semantic comparison. The proposed system comprises two primary components. The first focuses on gathering data from sensors and converting it into a reusable structured format, while the second component aims to identify the most relevant sensor data to augment a given user-provided dataset. The evaluation of the proposed approach involved comparing the performance of various large language models in generating representative word embeddings for each table to retrieve related sensor data. The results show promising performance in terms of precision and MRR (0.90 and 0.94 for the best-performing model, respectively), indicating the system’s ability to retrieve pertinent sensor data that fulfil user requirements. © 2024 by the authors.",data retrieval; FAIR principles; large language models; sensor data; word embeddings,,,,,,"Generalitat Valenciana, GVA; TED2021130890B-C21, CIAICO/2022/019, 101086387, PID2021-122263OB-C22; European Social Fund Plus, ESF: ACIF/2021/507; European Social Fund Plus, ESF","This research was partially funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union Next Generation EU/PRTR as part of the projects TED2021130890B-C21 and PID2021-122263OB-C22, as well a by REMARKABLE project (HORIZON-MSCA-2021-SE-0 action number: 101086387).

Even experienced engineers find it difficult to review every detail of technical specifications. In addition, it is not easy to transfer experienced knowledge to junior engineers. With the technological innovation of large language models such as ChatGPT, a fine-tuned language model is proposed as an effective solution for the automatic review of technical specification documents. Against this backdrop, this study examines the in-house technical specification documents that are not publicly available. Then, two fine-tuned large language models, GPT-3 and LLaMA2, are trained to answer questions related to technical specification documents. The results show that the fine-tuned LLaMA2 model generally outperforms the fine-tuned GPT-3 model in terms of accuracy, reliability, and conciseness of responses. In particular, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 model suppressed hallucinogenic effects better than the fine-tuned GPT-3 model. Based on the results, this study discussed the applicability and limitations of a fine-tuned large language model for in-house knowledge management. The results of this study are expected to assist practitioners in developing a domain-specific knowledge management solution by fine-tuning an open-source large language model with private datasets. © 2024 by the authors.",fine-tuning; GPT; knowledge management; large language model; LLaMA; technical specification document,,,,,,"Korea Electric Power Corporation, KEPCO; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, MOE: NRF-2020R1A2C1012739; Ministry of Education, MOE","This research was supported by the 2023 research fund of the KEPCO International Nuclear graduate School (KINGS), Republic of Korea and supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. NRF-2020R1A2C1012739).",,,,,,,,,,"Moon, S., Lee, G., Chi, S., Automated System for Construction Specification Review Using Natural Language Processing (2022) Adv.

This enables proactive maintenance measures to be implemented, improving equipment reliability and reducing production costs. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based PHM methods have made remarkable achievements, and it is widely used in various industries, such as railway, energy, and aviation, for condition monitoring, fault prediction, and health management. The emergence of large-scale foundation models (LSF-Models) such as ChatGPT and DALLE-E marks the entry of AI into a new era of AI-2.0 from AI-1.0, where deep models have rapidly evolved from a research paradigm of single-modal, single-task, and limited-data to a multi-modal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model paradigm. ChatGPT represents a landmark achievement in this research paradigm, offering hope for general AI due to its brilliant natural language understanding ability. However, the PHM field lacks a consensus on responding to this significant change, and systematic reviews and roadmaps are required to elucidate future development directions. Therefore, this paper expounds on the key components and latest developments of LSF-Models. Then, we systematically answered how to build LSF-Models applicable to PHM tasks and outlined the challenges and future development roadmaps for this research paradigm. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Fault diagnosis;

It aims at shaping the IVs to be a form that is more relevant to the underlying scenario, thereby accomplishing validation, verification (V&V), and calibration, certification (C&C) of each vehicle. However, such improved capabilities relies on the accumulation and analysis of an unprecedented volume of scenarios. Recently, Sora and other video generation models have opened up new horizons for Imaginative Intelligence. As an extension of TIV-DHW (Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop) on SE, this letter discusses the potential of Sora to change the scenario generation process by reducing physical shooting, increasing extreme scenario generation, thereby enabling more comprehensive training and testing of IVs. This letter also analyzes the limitations of Sora in accurately model physics and understand cause and effect, which may affect its effectiveness in SE applications. Last, through a comprehensive outlook, this letter aims to provide a potential direction for the development of Sora-like AI technology, thereby promoting the safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of IVs. © 2016 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; intelligent vehicles; scenarios engineering; Sora; text-to-video model,Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Vehicles; Decentralised; Generation process; Model physics; Scenario engineering; Scenarios generation; Sora; Text-to-video model; Training and testing; Video generation; Video modeling; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, F.-Y., Hu, J., Lai, J., Testing intelligence: Accelerating the verification and validation of intelligent vehicles (2023) IEEE Trans.

Yet, the intricate design and implementation of these systems necessitate adept knowledge and expertise, posing challenges for researchers and engineers. In response, this paper introduces IoT-AID, a Cyber Physical Recommendation System aimed at alleviating these challenges. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as decision support systems, IoT-AID relies on state-of-the-art techniques such as BERT and Sentence Transformers for semantic understanding and context-aware recommendations.

To enable Proactive HRC, various methods have been explored, including deep neural networks for visual detection, scene graph for decision-making, and reinforcement learning for robot execution. However, these methods often require re-training with domain-specific datasets in different scenarios, lacking generalizability and transferability for diverse manufacturing activities. The advent of Large Language Model (LLM) technology offers a promising solution for comprehending diverse tasks, modelling human intentions, and planning robot operations using natural vision-language instructions. This ability closely resembles human intelligence, specifically humanoid cognition, which allows flexible knowledge acquisition of the surrounding environment and exerting physical influence on tasks. Therefore, this paper delves into the concept of humanoid cognition in Proactive HRC and evaluates relevant LLM methods from the perspectives of task explainability, human-centricity, and robot executability. Based on the testing results, the authors provide discussions and future prospects for successfully integrating LLM approaches into Proactive HRC in the manufacturing domain. © 2024 IEEE.",,Anthropomorphic robots; Deep neural networks; Deep reinforcement learning; Graph neural networks; Human robot interaction; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Knowledge acquisition; Microrobots; Reinforcement learning; Robot learning; Robot programming; Robot vision; Visual languages; Decisions makings; Human-centric; Human-robot collaboration; Language model; Neural-networks; Reinforcement learnings; Scene-graphs; Self-organising; Smart manufacturing; Visual detection; Smart manufacturing,,,,,"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局: PolyU15210222, PolyU15206723; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; IMETKF2024010; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 52205244; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research work was partially supported by grants from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (No. PolyU15210222 and PolyU15206723), the open program at the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology (No. IMETKF2024010) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52205244).",,,,,,,,,,"Wang, L., A futuristic perspective on human-centric assembly (2022) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 62, pp. 199-201; Li, S., Zheng, P., Liu, S., Wang, Z., Wang, X.V., Zheng, L., Wang, L., Proactive human-robot collaboration: Mutual-cognitive, predictable, and self-organising perspectives (2023) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 81, p. 102510; Li, S., Zheng, P., Pang, S., Wang, X.V., Wang, L., Self-organising multiple human-robot collaboration: A temporal subgraph reasoningbased method (2023) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 68, pp. 304-312; Wang, P., Kershaw, J., Russell, M., Zhang, J., Zhang, Y., Gao, R.X., Data-driven process characterization and adaptive control in robotic arc welding (2022) CIRP Annals, 71 (1), pp. 45-48; Xie, H.-L., Wang, Q.-H., Ong, S., Li, J.-R., Chi, Z.-P., Adaptive human-robot collaboration for robotic grinding of complex workpieces (2022) CIRP Annals, 71 (1), pp. 285-288; Fan, J., Zheng, P., Lee, C.K., A multi-granularity scene segmentation network for human-robot collaboration environment perception (2022) 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 2105-2110; Li, S., You, Y., Wang Wang, X.V., Wang, L., Mutual-cognition for proactive human-robot collaboration: A mixed reality-enabled visual reasoning-based method (2024) IISE Transactions; Wang, B., Liu, Z., Li, Q., Prorok, A., Mobile robot path planning in dynamic environments through globally guided reinforcement learning (2020) IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 5 (4), pp. 6932-6939; Achiam, J., Adler, S., Agarwal, S., Ahmad, L., Akkaya, I., Aleman, F.L., Almeida, D., Anadkat, S., (2023) Gpt-4 technical report; Wang, Y., Wu, Y., Tang, S., He, W., Guo, X., Zhu, F., Bai, L., He, T., (2023) Hulk: A universal knowledge translator for human-centric tasks; Lin, K., Agia, C., Migimatsu, T., Pavone, M., Bohg, J., (2023) Text2motion: From natural language instructions to feasible plans; Vemprala, S., Bonatti, R., Bucker, A., Kapoor, A., Chatgpt for robotics: Design principles and model abilities (2023) Microsoft Auton.

On the shop floor, human operators contribute with their adaptability and flexibility in dynamic situations, while robots provide precision and the ability to perform repetitive tasks. However, the communication gap between human operators and robots limits the collaboration and coordination of human-robot teams in manufacturing systems. Our research presents a human-robot collaborative assembly framework that utilizes a large language model for enhancing communication in manufacturing environments. The framework facilitates human-robot communication by integrating voice commands through natural language for task management. A case study for an assembly task demonstrates the framework's ability to process natural language inputs and address real-time assembly challenges, emphasizing adaptability to language variation and efficiency in error resolution. The results suggest that large language models have the potential to improve human-robot interaction for collaborative manufacturing assembly applications. © 2024 IEEE.",,Industrial robots; Microrobots;

The use of multi-agent systems has improved adaptability and coordination but requires further advancements in rapid human instruction comprehension, operational adaptability, and coordination through natural language integration. Large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 enhance multi-agent manufacturing systems by enabling agents to communicate in natural language and interpret human instructions for decision-making. This research introduces a novel framework where large language models enhance the capabilities of agents in manufacturing, making them more adaptable, and capable of processing context-specific instructions. A case study demonstrates the practical application of this framework, showing how agents can effectively communicate, understand tasks, and execute manufacturing processes, including precise G-code allocation among agents. The findings highlight the importance of continuous large language model integration into multi-agent manufacturing systems and the development of sophisticated agent communication protocols for a more flexible manufacturing system. © 2024 IEEE.",,Resource valuation;

Within this context, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that enhance communication, streamline operations, and support complex decision-making tasks through advanced natural language processing capabilities. This paper explores the process of fine-tuning a foundational general-purpose LLM, specifically the open-source LLaMA 3 model, to cater to industrial applications. We delve into the methodology of fine-tuning LLaMA on domain-specific data from two distinct industrial scenarios (i.e., product management and production line operations). Our results demonstrate significant improvements in the model’s performance, accuracy, and relevance in generating responses, thereby enhancing decision-making and operational processes in industrial settings. Additionally, we propose the integration of the fine-tuned model into a chatbot system designed to assist human operators by providing targeted, accurate responses in real-time. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive guide for industry practitioners and researchers to harness the power of LLMs for specialized industrial tasks, ultimately contributing to the advancement of intelligent industrial automation and decision-making systems. ©2024 IEEE.",Domain-specific AI; Fine-tuning; Industry 5.0; Large Language Models (LLMs); QA Chatbot Systems,Decision making; Problem oriented languages; Chatbots; Domain specific; Domain-specific artificial intelligence; Fine tuning; Human-machine collaboration; Industry 5.0; Language model; Large language model; QA chatbot system; Question Answering; Smart manufacturing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cañas, H., Mula, J., Díaz-Madroñero, M., Campuzano-Bolarín, F., Implementing industry 4.0 principles (2021) Computers & industrial engineering, 158, p. 107379; Rosati, R., Romeo, L., Cecchini, G., Tonetto, F., Viti, P., Mancini, A., Frontoni, E., From knowledge-based to big data analytic model: a novel iot and machine learning based decision support system for predictive maintenance in industry 4.0 (2023) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 34 (1), pp. 107-121; Vargas, V.M., Rosati, R., Hervás-Martínez, C., Mancini, A., Romeo, L., Gutiérrez, P.A., A hybrid feature learning approach based on convolutional kernels for atm fault prediction using event-log data (2023) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 123, p. 106463; Rosati, R., Romeo, L., Vargas, V.M., Gutiérrez, P.A., Hervás-Martínez, C., Frontoni, E., A novel deep ordinal classification approach for aesthetic quality control classification (2022) Neural Computing and Applications, 34 (14), pp. 11625-11639; Vargas, V.M., Gutiérrez, P.A., Rosati, R., Romeo, L., Frontoni, E., Hervás-Martínez, C., Exponential loss regularisation for encouraging ordinal constraint to shotgun stocks quality assessment (2023) Applied Soft Computing, 138, p. 110191; Csalódi, R., Süle, Z., Jaskó, S., Holczinger, T., Abonyi, J., Industry 4.0-driven development of optimization algorithms: A systematic overview (2021) Complexity, 2021 (1), p. 6621235; Ribeiro, J., Lima, R., Eckhardt, T., Paiva, S., Robotic process automation and artificial intelligence in industry 4.0–a literature review (2021) Procedia Computer Science, 181, pp. 51-58; Santhi, A.R., Muthuswamy, P., Industry 5.0 or industry 4.0 s? introduction to industry 4.0 and a peek into the prospective industry 5.0 technologies (2023) International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM), 17 (2), pp. 947-979; Senesi, P., Mandolini, M., Lonzi, B., Rosati, R., User-centred product design with photorealistic virtual prototypes: A case study on process optimisation for aesthetic quality enhancement (2024) Procedia Computer Science, 232, pp. 831-838; Rane, N., Chatgpt and similar generative artificial intelligence (ai) for smart industry: role, challenges and opportunities for industry 4.0, industry 5.0 and society 5.0 (2023) Challenges and Opportunities for Industry, 4; Javaid, M., Haleem, A., Singh, R.P., A study on chatgpt for industry 4.0: Background, potentials, challenges, and eventualities (2023) Journal of Economy and Technology, 1, pp. 127-143; Min, B., Ross, H., Sulem, E., Veyseh, A.P.B., Nguyen, T.H., Sainz, O., Agirre, E., Roth, D., Recent advances in natural language processing via large pre-trained language models: A survey (2023) ACM Computing Surveys, 56 (2), pp. 1-40; Arefeen, M.A., Debnath, B., Chakradhar, S., Leancontext: Cost-efficient domain-specific question answering using llms (2024) Natural Language Processing Journal, 7, p. 100065; Zhao, Z., Fan, W., Li, J., Liu, Y., Mei, X., Wang, Y., Wen, Z., Tang, J., Recommender systems in the era of large language models (llms) (2024) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering; Li, Y., Wen, H., Wang, W., Li, X., Yuan, Y., Liu, G., Liu, J., Sun, Y., (2024) Personal llm agents: Insights and survey about the capability, efficiency and security, , arXiv preprint; Ghodratnama, S., Zakershahrak, M., Adapting llms for efficient, personalized information retrieval: Methods and implications (2023) International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, pp. 17-26. , Springer; Yang, F., Zhao, P., Wang, Z., Wang, L., Qiao, B., Zhang, J., Garg, M., Zhang, D., Empower large language model to perform better on industrial domain-specific question answering (2023) Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Industry Track, pp. 294-312; (2023) Chatgpt, , https://www.openai.com/chatgpt, accessed: 2024-08-02.

Therefore, the advancement of parallel intelligence powered crowdsensing intelligence (CSI) is witnessed, which is currently advancing toward linguistic intelligence. In this article, we propose a novel sensing paradigm, namely conversational crowdsensing, for Industry 5.0 (especially for social manufacturing). It can alleviate workload and professional requirements of individuals and promote the organization and operation of diverse workforce, thereby facilitating faster response and wider popularization of crowdsensing systems. Specifically, we design the architecture of conversational crowdsensing to effectively organize three types of participants (biological, robotic, and digital) from diverse communities. Through three levels of effective conversation (i.e., interhuman, human-AI, and inter-AI), complex interactions and service functionalities of different workers can be achieved to accomplish various tasks across three sensing phases (i.e., requesting, scheduling, and executing). Moreover, we explore the foundational technologies for realizing conversational crowdsensing, encompassing LLM-based multiagent systems, scenarios engineering and conversational human-AI cooperation. Finally, we present potential applications of conversational crowdsensing and discuss its implications. We envision that conversations in natural language will become the primary communication channel during crowdsensing process, enabling richer information exchange and cooperative problem-solving among humans, robots, and AI. © 2014 IEEE.",Conversational crowdsensing; crowdsensing intelligence (CSI); Industry 5.0; large language models (LLMs); parallel intelligence; retrieval augmented generation (RAG),Microrobots; Conversational crowdsensing; Crowdsensing intelligence; Cyber-physical systems; Industry 5.0; Intelligence models; Language model; Large language model; Large models; Parallel intelligence; Retrieval augmented generation; Service industry,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 21808181, 62173337, 72071207, 62202477; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National University of Defense Technology, NUDT: ZK-2023-21; National University of Defense Technology, NUDT","Received 8 June 2024; revised 2 August 2024 and 19 August 2024; accepted 27 August 2024.

As an inverse approach, this work investigates the feasibility of using LLMs to process formal hardware models and generate design documentations hereof. We automatically pre-process formalized system-level hardware specifications to create prompts for LLMs. Based on these prompts, an LLM generates an extensive, human-readable explanation of the system. Applying this workflow to a concrete example shows that LLMs are suitable for reducing documentation efforts. Nonetheless, we also note that the generated results are not always up to standard, and a manual review is still required. Compared to a fully manual documentation workflow, however, we still observe a noticeable productivity improvement. © 2024 IEEE.",Design documentation; formal specification; Large Language Model (LLM); metamodeling,Computer hardware description languages; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Specification languages; Design documentation; Hardware models; Inverse approach; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Metamodeling; Natural languages; System levels; Work-flows; Formal specification,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; ITEA: 01IS22084A",This work was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and ITEA within the project GenerIoT under contract number 01IS22084A.,,,,,,,,,,"Kunzelmann, R., Baerens, E., Gerl, D., Bhadra, M., Schwarz, N., Ecker, W., A universal specification methodology for quality ensured, highly automated generation of design models (2024) MBMV 2024; 27th Workshop, pp. 90-98. , Berlin, Germany: VDE Verlag; Fernando, S., Kunzelmann, R., Lopera, D.S., Al Halabi, J., Ecker, W., Leveraging large language models for the automated documentation of hardware designs (2024) 2024 13th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO), pp. 1-6; Xu, C., Sun, Q., Zheng, K., (2023) WizardLM: Empowering large language models to follow complex instructions, , Jun. 10. arXiv: 2304. 12244 [cs]","Fernando, S.; Infineon Technologies AgGermany; email: saruni.fernando@infineon.com

This new era of industrial intelligence is characterized by universality, reusability, cross-domain generalization, multimodality, and support for multi-task decision-making. We refer to this new form of industrial intelligence as Industrial Large Models (ILMs). To accelerate the development of ILMs, this paper proposes an integrated framework for Industrial Large Model. © 2024 IEEE.",Industrial Large Models; Large Language Models,Cross-domain; Decisions makings; Driving forces; Generalisation; Industrial large model; Language model; Large language model; Large models; Multi tasks; Multi-modality; Reusability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chen, J.N., Zhou, J.H., Revisiting industry 4.0 with a case study (2018) 2018 IEEE Int.

It is very complex to understand the intention of human during the assembly process, therefore, we proposed a method of autonomous HRC assembly driven by the fusion of large language model (LLM) and digital twin in this paper. The assembly state is recognized from two perspectives, including the perception of key parts based on transfer learning and YOLO, and perceive operator actions based on LSTM and attention mechanism. In order to improve the autonomy of HRC, a collaborative task decision method driven by fine-tuning LLM based on assembly domain knowledge is proposed. A case study of reducer assembly is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Assembly machines; Human form models; Industrial robots; Microrobots; Nanorobots; Robotic assembly; Transfer learning; Assembly process; Collaborative assembly; Cooperative robots; Human robots; Human-centric; Human-robot collaboration; Key parts; Language model; Part based; Transfer learning; Collaborative robots,,,,,Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality: L243009; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality,"The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their comments and feedback, which helped us to improve this paper.

While their potential is undeniable across various domains, in this paper we investigate their uncharted territory-the exploration of generating safety cases. Our primary objective is to delve into the existing knowledge base of ChatGPT (specifically, GPT-4), focusing specifically on its understanding of the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN), a well-established notation allowing to visually represent safety cases. Subsequently, in our preliminary evaluation, we perform four distinct experiments with GPT-4. These experiments are designed to assess its capacity for generating safety cases within a defined system and application domain. To measure the performance of GPT-4 in this context, we compare the results it generates with ground-truth safety cases respectively created for an x-ray system and a Machine Learning (ML)-enabled component for tire noise recognition (TNR) component in a vehicle. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates the capacity to automatically produce safety arguments that are moderately accurate and reasonable. Furthermore, it also exhibits the capability to automatically generate safety cases whose semantic closely aligns with the one of the reference safety cases used as ground-truths in our experiments. © 2024 IEEE.",Generative AI; Large language models; Machine learning; RE quality models and their automation; Safety assurance; Safety cases; Safety requirements,Knowledge based systems; Machine learning; Magnetic levitation vehicles; X ray apparatus; Generative AI; Ground truth; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Quality modeling; RE quality model and their automation; Safety assurance; Safety case; Safety requirements; Semantics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Koopman, P., Autonomous vehicles and software safety engineering (2022) ICSE keynote, , May 2022; Maksimov, M., Kokaly, S., Chechik, M., A survey of toolsupported assurance case assessment techniques (2019) ACM Computing Surveys, 52 (5); Retouniotis, A., Papadopoulos, Y., Sorokos, I., Parker, D., Matragkas, N., Sharvia, S., Model-connected safety cases (2017) Model-Based Safety and Assessment: 5th International Symposium, IMBSA 2017, pp. 50-63. , Trento, Italy, September 11-13, 2017, Proceedings 5 10437 LNCS; Bandur, V., Lawford, M., Mosser, S., Paige, R.F., Pantelic, V., Wassyng, A., Using assurance cases to prevent malicious behaviour from targeting safety vulnerabilities (2023) International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security, pp. 5-14. , Springer; Chelouati, M., Boussif, A., Beugin, J., El Koursi, E.-M., Graphical safety assurance case using goal structuring notation (gsn)-challenges, opportunities and a framework for autonomous trains (2023) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 230, p. 108933; (2021) Goal structuring notation standard version 3, , T.

Constructing a troubleshooting tree involves a rigorous process that integrates multidisciplinary expertise and begins with an in-depth analysis of system architecture, operations, and known failure modes. Information from diverse sources are typically used to draft the initial tree structure, which is then iteratively refined through real-world data and field feedback. To expedite this process, this paper explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract and structure information from unstructured text sources like service manuals, maintenance records, and design documents. In this work, we investigate three different product manuals and propose a method for generating an initial troubleshooting tree. Our results shows that the proposed method has data extraction coverage ranging from 36% to 64% and an extraction precision from 88% to 100%. We also performed a detailed analysis on the potential hallucination of the method and discuss the bottlenecks of the current process.

Precise and efficient segmentation of SAT images is crucial for detecting defects and assessing material properties in the semiconductor industry. However, current manual methods are often expensive and susceptible to human error. This study enhances the segmentation process of SAT images using the deep learning model SemiSA, which is fine-tuned from the Segment Anything model. In our experiments, SemiSA was trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Ohlabs TSAM-400 system, encompassing various semiconductor devices such as Flip Chip, Power Semiconductor, 6-inch and 12-inch Wafer, Transistor, and Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor. The results demonstrate that SemiSA significantly improves segmentation tasks across all types of SAT images of semiconductor devices. On average, there was a 17.89% enhancement in Dice Similarity Coefficient scores and a 24.26% improvement in Intersection over Union scores across all tasks. Additionally, this work also proposes an efficient framework tailored specifically for SAT images. The main objective of developing this segmentation tool is to provide researchers and experts with a valuable tool for advancing the semiconductor evaluation and quality control field.

However, the technical implementation of IoT-based or AI-based solutions requires interaction and information exchange between the various components of complex information processing systems. Students of interdisciplinary study programs, such as industrial engineering, often possess conceptual yet isolated knowledge of manufacturing systems, IT infrastructure, and information processing without proficiency regarding application programming interface (API) usage. However, APIs are paramount for enabling the interaction of individual components of complex information processing systems. Unfortunately, adapting the general descriptions in API documentation to a student's specific application is often challenging, hindering a comprehensive hands-on learning experience for students training on implementing applications into manufacturing systems of learning factories. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate the utilization of APIs for students’ hands-on training on implementing applications and the respective information processing within the context of manufacturing systems and learning factories. The proposed approach comprises an LLM extended using context data specific to the employed test API and enables user interaction via a natural language dialogue-based chat interface. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",API; Learning Factory; LLM; Manufacturing Systems,Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Engineering education; Internet of things; Learning systems; Applications programming interfaces; Complex information; Information exchanges; Information processing systems; Inter-disciplinary studies; IT infrastructures; Language model; Large language model; Learning factory; Technical implementation; Students,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maisiri, W., Darwish, H., van Dyk, L., An investigation of industry 4.0 skills requirements (2019) SAJIE, 30 (3). , https://doi.org/10.7166/30-3-2230; Schallock, B., Rybski, C., Jochem, R., Kohl, H., Learning Factory for Industry 4.0 to provide future skills beyond technical training (2018) Procedia Manufacturing, 23, pp. 27-32. , https://doi. org/10.1016/j.promfg.2018.03.156; Vaswani, A., (2017) Attention is All You Need; Mitchell, M., How do we know how smart AI systems are?

However, with the increasing requirements of computing infrastructure and data privacy protection for large foundation models, existing learning frameworks face challenges such as data privacy leakage, poor scalability, and deployment difficulties. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel collaborative Transformer Block (TB)- wise training framework based on Federated Learning (FL), which consists of three stages: pre-training, graph regularization, and personalized training. To tackle the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in distributed data, we design a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based update operator that captures local training representations. Besides, we conduct an analysis based on feature similarity to enhance the interpretability of our algorithm. We choose popular vision Transformer models for the experiments, extensive results demonstrate that our framework can jointly train multiple clients to build a foundation model while improving the single client&#x0027;s personalized performance. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks under various data distributions and system heterogeneity settings, highlighting its robust performance.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of these studies about LLM -enabled CPS. First, we overview LLM-enabled CPS and the roles that LLM plays in CPS. Second, we categorize existing works in terms of the application domain and discuss their key contributions. Third, we present commonly-used metrics and benchmarks for LLM -enabled CPS evaluation.

With this paper we seek to answer calls for research on the interactions between human and AI agents and their outcomes. We adopt the Information Systems (IS) Delegation Framework (Baird & Maruping, 2021) to look at dynamics in relationships between human agents and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-based agentic IS artefacts and how these dynamics manifest. By conducting and analyzing data from semi-structured interviews we were able to identify five salient agentic relationship dynamics affecting common understanding, willingness to delegate, cognitive load in human agents, confidence, and human agents' abilities to break GPT-based agentic IS artefacts' “thought loops”. With this we aim to provide nuanced insight into GPT-based agentic IS artefacts and agentic relationship dynamics involving cognitive tasks. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

For seamless synchronization with virtual spaces, Vehicle Twins (VTs) are constructed as digital representations of physical entities. However, resource-intensive VTs updating and high mobility of vehicles require intensive computation, communication, and storage resources, especially for their migration among RSUs with limited coverages. To address these issues, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism to optimize resource allocation during VTs migration by considering both price and non-monetary attributes, e.g., location and reputation. In this mechanism, we propose a two-stage matching for vehicular users and Metaverse service providers in multi-attribute resource markets. First, the resource attributes matching algorithm obtains the resource attributes perfect matching, namely, buyers and sellers can participate in a double Dutch auction (DDA). Then, we train a DDA auctioneer using a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the auction process. We compare the performance of social welfare and auction information exchange costs with state-of-the-art baselines under different settings. Simulation results show that our proposed GPT-based DRL auction schemes have better performance than others.

The main focus here lies on generating and automating the hardware design itself. We propose an alternative application of LLMs, using them to create human-readable design documentation from formal hardware models. We integrate LLMs into a documentation generation framework, which reads a formal specification of a hardware system and pre-processes it into suitable prompts. These prompts guide an LLM in articulating a natural language description of the system. Our findings affirm the potential of LLMs as practical tools to alleviate the documentation burden on engineers. However, they are not a standalone solution yet. A manual review of the generated documents is still required to ensure adherence to specific style and structure guidelines. Nonetheless, we show that this process demands significantly less effort than writing documentations manually. © 2024 IEEE.",Design documentation; formal specification; Large Language Model (LLM); metamodeling,Computational linguistics; Computer aided design; 'current; Automation industry; Design documentation; Electronics design automation; Hardware design; Human-readable; Language model; Large language model; Metamodeling; Work productivity; Formal specification,,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; ITEA: 01IS22084A",This work was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and ITEA within the project GenerIoT under contract number 01IS22084A.,,,,,,,,,,"Blocklove, J., Garg, S., Karri, R., Pearce, H., Chip-chat: Challenges and opportunities in conversational hardware design (2023) 2023 ACM/IEEE 5th Workshop on Machine Learning for CAD (MLCAD), pp. 1-6. , Sep; Chang, K., Wang, Y., Ren, H., (2023) ChipGPT: How far are we from natural language hardware design, , Jun. 19. arXiv: 2305. 14019 [cs]; Liu, S., Fang, W., Lu, Y., Zhang, Q., Zhang, H., Xie, Z., (2024) RTLCoder: Outperforming GPT-3. 5 in design RTL generation with our open-source dataset and lightweight solution, , Feb. 20. arXiv: 2312. 08617 [cs]; He, Z., Wu, H., Zhang, X., ChatEDA: A large language model powered autonomous agent for EDA (2023) 2023 ACM/IEEE 5th Workshop on Machine Learning for CAD (MLCAD), pp. 1-6. , Sep; Cosler, M., Hahn, C., Mendoza, D., Schmitt, F., Trippel, C., Nl2spec: Interactively translating unstructured natural language to temporal logics with large language models (2023) Computer Aided Verification, pp. 383-396. , C.

Robots equipped with advanced sensing capabilities can work alongside humans, performing repetitive and physically demanding tasks, while humans focus on more complex and strategic aspects of production. Several concepts have been presented so far involving a variety of h/w and information exchange means, like gestures, physical and virtual buttons and voice commands. The main drawback identified that limits the fluidity of the interaction is that the commands are pre-programmed and have to be memorized. This paper presents a framework to advance HRI in both execution and programming phases, through the use of AI, exploring large language models (LLMs), allowing humans to communicate in natural language. A reference use case is presented to validate the effectiveness of this approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",human augmentation; human-robot interaction; large language models; manufacturing,Computational linguistics; Man machine systems; Human augmentation; Humans-robot interactions; Increased productivity; Increased safety; Information exchanges; Language model; Large language model; Modeling approach; Production process; Voice command; Human robot interaction,,,,,"European Commission, EC; 101058521","This research has been supported by the EU project \u201CCONVERGING Social industrial collaborative environments integrating AI, Big Data and Robotics for smart manufacturing\u201D.

However, Industrial Foundation Models (IFMs) remain almost unexplored, and the industrial sector has domain-specific issues and challenges to address when harnessing the capabilities of foundation models. Therefore, we introduce the concept and construction paradigm of IFMs and propose a 5-dimensional general framework of the IFMs. Moreover, we present the key research issues and technologies of IFMs and discuss some advanced and potential industrial applications. We hope this paper can serve as a useful resource for researchers seeking to innovate within the domain of IFMs. © 2024 IEEE.",deep learning; foundation models; industrial foundation models,Deep learning; Foundations; Natural language processing systems; Deep learning; Foundation models; Industrial foundation model; Industrial sector; Key Issues; Language processing; Modelling framework; Natural languages; Technologies and applications; Industrial research,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62103046, 72192844, 72201266, 72192843; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2021YFB1715700; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 2023CX01020, E1E40805X2; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021YFB1715700; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62103046, 72201266, 72192843, and 72192844; in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant E1E40805X2 and 2023CX01020.",,,,,,,,,,"Bommasani, R., (2021) On the opportunities and risks of foundation models, , http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258, [Online]; Zhou, C., (2023) A comprehensive survey on pretrained foundation models: A history from BERT to ChatGPT, , https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.09419, [Online]; Ji, Z., Survey of hallucination in natural language generation (2023) ACM Comput.

Typically, LLMs undergo pre-training on extensive text corpora, usually using billions of tokens to develop a foundational model. To better align LLMs with human preferences and directives or to fulfill specific application needs, methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and direct preference optimization (DPO) have been introduced and demonstrated to be effective. These advancements facilitate more intuitive and efficient human-AI interactions. However, the substantial resource requirements throughout the training process pose challenges for individual users and smaller organizations. © 2024 IEEE.",AI reliability; Large language model,Abstracting; Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Reliability; AI reliability; Human competencies; Industrial scenarios; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural languages; Performance; Pre-training; Text corpora; Reinforcement learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brown, T., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J.D., Dhariwal, P., Neelakantan, A., Askell, A., Language models are few-shot learners (2020) Advances in neural information processing systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901; Radford, A., Wu, J., Child, R., Luan, D., Amodei, D., Sutskever, I., Language models are unsupervised multitask learners (2019) OpenAI blog, 1 (8), p. 9; Li, Z., Wang, C., Wang, S., Cuiyun, G., Protecting intellectual property of large language model-based code generation apis via watermarks (2023) Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, CCS 2023, , Copenhagen, Denmark, November 26-30, 2023.

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their impressive natural language understanding and generating capabilities, can play a key role in automatically refining and decomposing requirements after each update. In this study, we propose a prototype of a pipeline of prompts and LLMs that receives an item definition and outputs solutions in the form of safety requirements. This pipeline also performs a review of the requirement dataset and identifies redundant or contradictory requirements. We first identified the necessary characteristics for performing HARA and then defined tests to assess an LLM's capability in meeting these criteria. We used design science with multiple iterations and let experts from different companies evaluate each cycle quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, the prototype was implemented at a case company and the responsible team evaluated its efficiency. © 2024 IEEE.",Autonomous Vehicles; ChatGPT; DevOps; Hazard Analysis Risk Assessment; Large Language Model; LLM; Prompt Engineering; Requirement Engineering; Safety,Autonomous Vehicles; ChatGPT; Hazard analyze risk assessment; Hazards analysis; Language model; Large language model; Prompt engineering; Requirement engineering; Risks assessments; Requirements engineering,,,,,Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse; 2021-02585,"This work has been partially supported by Sweden's Innovation Agency (Vinnova, diarienummer: 2021-02585), and by the Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.",,,,,,,,,,"ISO 26262:2018 (all parts), Road Vehicles-Functional Safety, standard, International Organization for Standardization, 2018; ISO 21448:2022, Road Vehicles-Safety of the Intended Functionality, standard, International Organization for Standardization, 2022; What is DevOps?, , https://cloud.google.com/devops, Accessed: 2023-09-22; Nouri, A., Berger, C., Törner, F., An Industrial Experience Report about Challenges from Continuous Monitoring, Improvement, and Deployment for Autonomous Driving Features (2022) Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, pp. 358-365; Scholtes, M., Westhofen, L., Turner, L.R., Lotto, K., Schuldes, M., Weber, H., Wagener, N., Eckstein, L., 6-Layer Model for a Structured Description and Categorization of Urban Traffic and Environment (2020) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 59131-59147; Johansson, R., Efficient Identification of Safety Goals in the Automotive E/E Domain (2016) 8th European Congress on Embedded Real Time Software and Systems (ERTS 2016), , (TOULOUSE, France), Jan; Nouri, A., Berger, C., Törner, F., On STPA for Distributed Development of Safe Autonomous Driving: An Interview Study (2023) Proceedings of the 49th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA), (DURRES, ALBANIA), , Sep; Brown, T., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J.D., Dhariwal, P., Neelakantan, A., Amodei, D., Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (2020) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901. , (H.

In this paper, a Complaint Text Classification Framework (CCF) is proposed, leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models to categorize complaint information efficiently. CCF adopts a multi-step approach, including real-time monitoring, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification prediction, with the aim of enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of complaint categorization for organizations grappling with vast datasets. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that bolstered by the utilization of the Yi-34B large model, CCF excels in accurately categorizing complaints, underscoring its potential to streamline complaint management processes within today's data-driven environment.

This shift can be attributed to LLMs' powerful, emergent properties which enable their adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal to no fine tuning via prompting. However, we find that LLM-driven task planning is not a solved problem. In this work we measure the extent to which these models can be adapted to complex and domain-specific task planning via few-shot prompting. Additionally, we contribute quantitative and qualitative analysis on prompt robustness. Lastly, to meet the challenges of adapting EAI systems to real-world, industrial domains, we adopt a human-in-the-loop approach to guarantee safe and interpretable task planning and execution. We successfully demonstrate co-located, human-robot teaming where an Augmented Reality (AR) headset mediates information exchanged between an EAI agent and human operator for a variety of inspection tasks. To our knowledge the use of an AR headset for multimodal grounding and the application of EAI to industrial tasks are novel contributions within Embodied AI research. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and The Robotics Society of Japan.",foundation models; human robot collaboration; language grounding; multimodality; Natural language processing,Computational linguistics; Industrial research; Natural language processing systems; Robot programming; Foundation models; Human-robot collaboration; Language grounding; Language model; Language processing; Model-driven; Multi-modality; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Task planning; Augmented reality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bommasani, R., Hudson, D.A., Adeli, E., https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258, On the opportunities and risks of foundation models; 2021.

Prior studies explored factual knowledge extraction from textual documents. However, maintenance knowledge in manuals is more task-centric rather than factual knowledge and often documented in an unstructured Portable Document Format (PDF), posing challenges for knowledge extraction. Addressing this, this research develops effective methods to extract task-centric maintenance knowledge from unstructured PDF manuals. A new Task-centric Knowledge Graph (TCKG) schema centralized on maintenance task components (MTCs) is proposed to address the need for structured knowledge representation. A method (Heterogeneous Graph-based Method, HGM) for knowledge extraction is then proposed, which is enhanced by incorporating visual and spatial information. In the experiments, the proposed HGM exhibits robust performance in the knowledge extraction process, surpassing the baseline Graph-based Interaction Model with a Tracker (GIT) method in MTCs extraction by 13.3%, and the baseline Translate Embedding (TransE) method in MTCs' relation extraction by 3.8%. A series of ablation studies also prove that including visual and spatial information through the proposed method can improve the relation extraction performance by over 10%. This research supplies valuable insights for future developments in information extraction from maintenance manuals. © 2024 The Author(s).

In contrast to traditional approaches to conversational agents, HERO-GPT utilizes a series of dynamically interchangeable documents instead of datasets, hand-written rules, or conversational examples, to provide information on the given scenario. This paper presents the system's capability to adapt to an industrial domain scenario through the integration of a GPT-based Large Language Model and an object detector to support Visual Question Answering. HERO-GPT is capable of offering conversational guidance on various aspects of industrial contexts, including information on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), machinery, procedures, and best practices. Experiments performed in an industrial laboratory with real users demonstrate HERO-GPT's effectiveness. Results indicate that users clearly prefer the proposed virtual assistant over traditional supporting materials such as paper-based manuals in the considered scenario. Moreover, the performance of the proposed system are shown to be comparable or superior to those of traditional approaches, while requiring little domainspecific data for the setup of the system.

The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a 'semantic node' data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the 'semantic node' and generate standardized digital twin models (AAS instance models in the context of Industry 4.0) from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model by automatically translating unstructured textual data into a standardized AAS model. The generated AAS model can be integrated into AAS-compliant digital twin software for seamless information exchange and communication. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications.

In particular, prompt engineering and in-context learning enable LLMs to operate effectively in scenarios with minimal training data, where they demonstrate proficiency with only giving precise instructions or a few examples. The advanced reasoning abilities of LLMs have been instrumental in the development of intelligent assistants. These assistants often rely on accessing information from comprehensive databases such as knowledge graphs (KGs) through natural language. The process of converting natural language requests into query language to retrieve information from databases is known as query generation (QG). One challenge in QG is the evaluation of the LLMs' performance due to the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an automated evaluation framework tailored for QG, featuring three key metrics: Gold Query Accuracy, Execution Accuracy, and Execution Rate. We focus on the exemplary use case of accessing a graph database in a supply chain management (SCM) setting via a natural language interface. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and metrics in accurately evaluating model performance for QG tasks. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This paper endeavors to construct a proactive risk identification model aimed at enhancing SC resilience. Our approach incorporates agent models, capable of continuous monitoring and early warning recommendations. To imbue these agents with intelligence, we harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate text comprehension. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian network (BN) as an agent, utilizing news feeds as its primary information source. We introduce a novel methodology, leveraging the expertise of risk managers and LLMs, to determine the relevance of detected events to the targeted SC risks. This research not only strives to equip businesses with the foresight to anticipate potential risk events but also emphasizes the identification and analysis of contributing events. These contributing events are systematically evaluated to understand their potential to precipitate primary risk events, thereby providing a more nuanced insight into the causative chains that lead to SC disruptions. Our methodology enables the proactive quantification of risk likelihood, enhancing predictive capabilities in SC management. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Dashboards have traditionally been the primary interface for accessing and interpreting data. However, they can lack adaptability and may overwhelm users with information. It is important to consider alternative methods of presenting data to avoid information overload. In response, Industry 5.0 (I5.0) has emerged, advocating for a human-centric approach. Advancements in technology, specifically auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs), have enabled the development of Intelligent Cognitive Assistants (ICAs) that enhance user interactions through natural language dialog. This paper presents the initial steps towards constructing an LLM-based ICA for I5.0 applications. Our system integrates industrial data from IoT-connected machines into a chatbot interface, with the aim of simplifying the decision-making process for managers and operators. Through expert evaluation, we are iteratively refining our prototype before conducting usability tests with end-users. This will lay the groundwork for future developments in human-centric industrial solutions. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Human-Computer Interaction; Industry 5.0; Large Language Models,Computational linguistics; Decision making; Human computer interaction; Iterative methods; Chatbots; Human-centric; Industrial operations; Industry 5.0; Information overloads; Intelligent assistants; Language model; Large language model; Model-based OPC; Remote monitoring and control; Industry 4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Özköse, H., Güney, G., The effects of industry 4.0 on productivity: A scientific mapping study (2023) Technology in Society, 75, p. 102368. , https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X23001732, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc. 2023.102368; Few, S., (2006) Information dashboard design: The effective visual communication of data, , O’Really; Tavera Romero, C.

The performance of existing general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in specific domains falls considerably short of expectations. This study aims to invigorate the utilization of a vast amount of high-quality design data, integrating multimodal methods to deeply embed AI into the design process. Taking industrial design as a case study, this research selected databases of entries from three internationally recognized design awards, encompassing key data fields such as names of works, award statuses, and design descriptions, totaling 84,773 design data entries. Through extracting and analyzing design data, this research fully exploits the data resources of the design and intelligent manufacturing industry, constructing a heuristic design innovation method that incorporates information from award-winning works. By fusing design data with LLM, this study developed DIABot, a heuristic design innovation tool based on LLMs, inspired by the ReAct method.

In the field of autonomous driving systems, driving scenario data are important for the training and testing of critical modules. However, the corner scenario cases are usually rare and necessary to be extended. Existing methods cannot handle the interpretation and reasoning of the generation process well, which reduces the reliability and usability of the generated scenarios. With the rapid development of Foundation Models, especially the large language model (LLM), we can conduct scenario generation via more powerful tools. In this article, we propose LLMScenario, a novel LLM-driven scenario generation framework, which is composed of scenario prompt engineering, LLM scenario generation, and evaluation feedback tuning. The minimum scenario description specific to LLM is given by scenario analysis and ablation studies. We also appropriately design the score functions in terms of reality and rarity to evaluate the generated scenarios. The model performance is further enhanced through chain-of-thoughts and experiences. Different LLMs are also compared with our framework. Experimental results on naturalistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMScenario, which can provide solid support for scenario engineering in Industry 5.0. © 2024 IEEE.",Large language model (LLM); scenario engineering; scenario generation,Autonomous vehicles; Computational linguistics; Job analysis; Autonomous Vehicles; Cognition; Language model; Large language model; Model-driven; Scenario engineering; Scenarios generation; Task analysis; Tuning; Semantics,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2021YFB2501200; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC",This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2021YFB2501200.

This is our opportunity to enhance the functionality of Digital Twin (DT) solutions in various sectors. The integration of FMs into the DT application is particularly relevant due to the increased prevalence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in real-world applications. In this position paper, we begin to explain a novel perspective on this integration by exploring the potential of enhanced predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and improved handling of complex data within DTs — by way of designated purposes. Ultimately, we aim to uncover hidden value of enhanced reliable decision-making, whereby systems can make more informed, accurate and timely decisions, based on comprehensive data analytics and predictive insights. Mentioning selected ongoing cases, we highlight some benefits and challenges, like computational demand, data privacy concerns, and the need for transparency in AI decision-making. Underscoring the transformative implications of integrating FMs into the DT paradigm, a shift towards more intelligent, versatile and dynamic systems becomes clearer. We caution against the challenges of computational resources, safety considerations and interpretability. This step is pivotal towards unlocking unprecedented potential for advanced data-driven solutions in various industries. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",Artificial Intelligence; Digital Twin; Foundation Model,,,,,,"European Commission, EC; 101057437","This study has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101057437 (BioDT project, https://doi.org/10.3030/101057437).

In manufacturing, operating production lines has become increasingly knowledge-intensive, putting strain on a factory's capacity to train and support new operators. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to retrieve information from the extensive knowledge contained in factory documentation and knowledge shared by expert operators. The system aims to efficiently answer queries from operators and facilitate the sharing of new knowledge. We conducted a user study at a factory to assess its potential impact and adoption, eliciting several perceived benefits, namely, enabling quicker information retrieval and more efficient resolution of issues. However, the study also highlighted a preference for learning from a human expert when such an option is available. Furthermore, we benchmarked several commercial and open-sourced LLMs for this system. The current state-of-the-art model, GPT-4, consistently outperformed its counterparts, with open-source models trailing closely, presenting an attractive option given their data privacy and customization benefits. In summary, this work offers preliminary insights and a system design for factories considering using LLM tools for knowledge management.

However, it is still unknown whether state-of-the-art LLMs master sufficient knowledge related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It will be inspiring if LLMs can think and learn like professionals in the HVAC industry. Hence, this study investigates the performance of LLMs on mastering the knowledge and skills related to the HVAC industry by letting them take the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination, an authoritative examination in the HVAC industry. Three key knowledge capabilities are explored: recall, analysis and application. Twelve representative LLMs are tested such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLaMA. According to the results, GPT-4 passes the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination with scores from 74 to 78, which is higher than about half of human examinees. Besides, GPT-3.5 passes the examination twice out of five times. It demonstrates that some LLMs such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have great potential to assist or replace humans in designing and operating HVAC systems. However, they still make some mistakes sometimes due to the lack of knowledge, poor reasoning capabilities and unsatisfactory equation calculation abilities. Accordingly, four future research directions are proposed to reveal how to utilize and improve LLMs in the HVAC industry: teaching LLMs to use design tools or software in the HVAC industry, enabling LLMs to read and analyze the operational data from HVAC systems, developing tailored corpuses for the HVAC industry, and assessing the performance of LLMs in real-world HVAC design and operation scenarios. © 2024",Artificial general intelligence; ChatGPT; GPT-4; HVAC systems; Large language model,"Computational linguistics; Air conditioning industry; Artificial general intelligences; ChatGPT; Conditioning systems; GPT-4; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system; Language model; Large language model; Performance; HVAC",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 52161135202; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; 2023SZD0028; Zhejiang University, ZJU: 2022FZZX01-09; Zhejiang University, ZJU","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( No. 52161135202 ), Hangzhou Key Scientific Research Plan Project ( No. 2023SZD0028 ), the Basic Research Funds for the Central Government \u2018Innovative Team of Zhejiang University\u2019 ( No. 2022FZZX01-09 ), and China Scholarship Fund.",,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, C., Li, J., Zhao, Y., Li, T., Chen, Q., Zhang, X., Qiu, W., Problem of data imbalance in building energy load prediction: concept, influence, and solution (2021) Appl.

In this research, we evaluate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture domain-specific knowledge, using ISF as a case study. Recognizing common LLMs' limitations such as potential inaccuracies and outdated information reliance, we propose a comprehensive approach involving automated and adaptive knowledge extraction, enrichment, and integration into an ISF-specific dataset. We then fine-tune the LLMs for ISF-related text classification and prompt response tasks. Our results reveal a significant enhancement in LLMs' performance within the ISF domain, with a domain knowledge acquisition rate exceeding that of GPT-3.5 by 10.4%, achieved by the fine-tuned Alpaca-33B model. Additionally, we introduce a novel conversational prototype designed to refine the accuracy and relevance of LLMs in the ISF domain.

The birth of the segment anything is a groundbreaking step towards creating a universal intelligent model. Due to its superior performance in general object segmentation, it quickly gained attention and interest. This makes SAM particularly attractive in industrial surface defect segmentation, especially for complex industrial scenes with limited training data. However, its segmentation ability for specific industrial scenes remains unknown. Therefore, in this work, we select three representative and complex industrial surface defect detection scenarios, namely strip steel surface defects, tile surface defects, and rail surface defects, to evaluate the segmentation performance of SAM. Our results show that although SAM has great potential in general object segmentation, it cannot achieve satisfactory performance in complex industrial scenes.

The primary challenge, however, lies in the complexity of hardware-specific issues that are not adequately addressed by the natural language or software code knowledge typically acquired during the pretraining stage. Additionally, the scarcity of datasets specific to the hardware domain poses a significant hurdle in developing a foundational model. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces Hardware Phi-1.5B, an innovative large language model specifically tailored for the hardware domain of the semiconductor industry. We have developed a specialized, tiered dataset - comprising small, medium, and large subsets - and focused our efforts on pretraining using the medium dataset. This approach harnesses the compact yet efficient architecture of the Phi-1.5B model. The creation of this first pre-trained, hardware domain-specific large language model marks a significant advancement, offering improved performance in hardware design and verification tasks and illustrating a promising path forward for AI applications in the semiconductor sector. © 2024 IEEE.",Generative AI; Hardware Design; Hardware Verification; Large Language Model,Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Industrial research; Semiconductor device manufacture; Design verification; Domain-specific knowledge; Generative AI; Hardware design; Hardware domain; Hardware verification; Language model; Large language model; Pre-training; Semiconductor industry; Large datasets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hains, G., Jakobsson, A., Khmelevsky, Y., Towards formal methods and software engineering for deep learning: Security, safety and productivity for dl systems development (2018) 2018 Annual IEEE international systems conference (syscon).

However, conventional UAV systems often require complex control schemes and lack adaptability, limiting their efficacy in variable environments such as indoor inspections. This paper introduces an innovative system integrating the cutting-edge Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models and dense captioning models for autonomous navigation and fault detection in indoor environments. Our approach, displaying human-like flexibility, allows the drone to interpret and respond to natural language commands, vastly enhancing its accessibility and user-friendliness. Simultaneously, the drone utilizes object dictionaries derived from dense captioning of its captured images, facilitating an advanced understanding of its surroundings. These capabilities equip the drone to adapt its behavior and effectively handle unexpected scenarios, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of indoor inspections. This research contributes to revolutionizing building inspections, making the process more user-friendly, and localizable to a broader user base. © 2024 ASCE.",,Aircraft detection; Antennas; Fault detection; Inspection; Object detection; Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Complex control; Control schemes; Innovative systems; Inspection and surveillance; Natural languages; Objects detection; Robotic systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Variable environment; Drones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brown, T.B., (2020) Language Models are Few-Shot Learners; Girshick, R., Fast R-CNN (2015) 2015 IEEE Int.

Although machine learning has been used for intrusion detection in the IIoT, datasets with representative data of common attacks of IIoT network traffic are limited and often imbalanced. Data augmentation techniques address these problems by creating artificial data in classes with fewer samples. In this work, we evaluate the use of data augmentation when training intrusion detection models based on IIoT traffic data. We compare Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and variations on the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) and evaluate their capability to enhance intrusion detection performance. We examine the performance of five intrusion detection algorithms when trained with augmented datasets to models trained with the original non-augmented dataset. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluated the algorithms' performance in the different scenarios using the same test dataset, which does not contain synthetic data. The results show the need for a systematic evaluation before employing data augmentation, as its impact on classification performance depends on the algorithm, data, and used technique. While deep neural networks benefit from data augmentation, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which achieved superior performance in intrusion detection between all evaluated classifiers (with F1-Score over 91%), didn't have any performance improvement when trained with augmented data. The evaluation of data generated by GPT-based methods shows such methods (especially GReaT) generate invalid data for both numerical and categorical features in a way that leads to performance degradation in multiclass classification. © 2013 IEEE.",cybersecurity; data augmentation; IIoT; machine learning,Classification (of information); Cybersecurity; Deep neural networks; Intrusion detection; Network security; Numerical methods; Statistical tests; Classification algorithm; Cyber security; Data augmentation; Industrial internet of thing; Intrusion-Detection; Machine-learning; Random forests; Telecommunications traffic; Internet of things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leber, J., (2020) General Electric Pitches An Industrial Internet, , https://www.technologyreview.com/2012/11/28/114725/general-electric-pitches-an-industrial-internet/, Apr; Ali Laghari, R., Mekid, S., Comprehensive approach toward IIoT based condition monitoring of machining processes (2023) Measurement, 217. , Aug., Art. no. 113004; Fiestas, E., Linares, P., Prado, S., Integration of an IIoT platform with a deep learning based computer vision system for seedling quality control automation (2021) Proc.

In the pervasive IoT era, their deployment on edge devices is more compelling than ever. However, their gigantic model footprint has hindered on-device learning applications which enable AI models to continuously learn and adapt to changes over time. Back-propagation, in use by the majority of deep learning frameworks, is computationally intensive and requires storing intermediate activations into memory to cope with the model’s weights update. Recently, “Forward-only algorithms” have been proposed since they are biologically plausible alternatives. By applying more “forward” passes, this class of algorithms can achieve memory reductions with respect to more naive forward-only approaches and by removing the need to store intermediate activations. This comes at the expense of increased computational complexity. This paper considered three Large Language Model: DistilBERT, GPT-3 Small and AlexaTM. It investigated quantitatively any improvements about memory usage and computational complexity brought by known approaches named PEPITA and MEMPEPITA with respect to backpropagation. For low number of tokens in context, and depending on the model, PEPITA increases marginally or reduces substantially arithmetic operations. On the other hand, for large number of tokens in context, PEPITA reduces computational complexity by 30% to 50%. MEMPEPITA increases PEPITA’s complexity by one third. About memory, PEPITA and backpropagation, require a comparable amount of memory to store activations, while MEMPEPITA reduces it by 50% to 94% with the benefits being more evident for architectures with a long sequence of blocks. In various real case scenarios, MEMPEPITA’s memory reduction was essential for meeting the tight memory requirements of 128 MB equipped edge consumer devices, which are commonly available as smartphone and industrial application multi processors. © 2024 by the authors.",backpropagation; forward learning; Large Language Models; MEMPEPITA; Natural Language Processing; on-device learning; PEPITA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.N., Kaiser, L., Polosukhin, I., Attention is All you Need (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30. , Guyon I., Luxburg U.V., Bengio S., Wallach H., Fergus R., Vishwanathan S., Garnett R., (eds), Curran Associates, Inc., Red Hook, NY, USA; Team, N., Costa-jussà, M.R., Cross, J., Çelebi, O., Elbayad, M., Heafield, K., Heffernan, K., Licht, D., No Language Left Behind: Scaling Human-Centered Machine Translation (2022) arXiv, , 2207.04672; Zhang, Z., Yang, J., Zhao, H., Retrospective Reader for Machine Reading Comprehension (2020) arXiv, , 2001.09694; Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., Liu, P.J., Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer (2020) arXiv, , 1910.10683; Jiang, H., He, P., Chen, W., Liu, X., Gao, J., Zhao, T., SMART: Robust and Efficient Fine-Tuning for Pre-trained Natural Language Models through Principled Regularized Optimization (2020) Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, , Online, 5–10 July 2020, Association for Computational Linguistics, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Yang, Z., Dai, Z., Yang, Y., Carbonell, J., Salakhutdinov, R., Le, Q.V., XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding (2020) arXiv, , 1906.08237; Wang, S., Fang, H., Khabsa, M., Mao, H., Ma, H., Entailment as Few-Shot Learner (2021) arXiv, , 2104.14690; Aghajanyan, A., Shrivastava, A., Gupta, A., Goyal, N., Zettlemoyer, L., Gupta, S., Better Fine-Tuning by Reducing Representational Collapse (2020) arXiv, , 2008.03156; Kaplan, J., McCandlish, S., Henighan, T., Brown, T.B., Chess, B., Child, R., Gray, S., Amodei, D., Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models (2020) arXiv, , 2001.08361; Brown, T.B., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J., Dhariwal, P., Neelakantan, A., Askell, A., Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (2020) arXiv, , 2005.14165; Kim, S., Hooper, C., Wattanawong, T., Kang, M., Yan, R., Genc, H., Dinh, G., Mahoney, M.W., Full Stack Optimization of Transformer Inference: A Survey (2023) arXiv, , 2302.14017; Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J., Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), , San Juan, Puerto Rico, 2–4 May 2016; Liu, Z., Li, J., Shen, Z., Huang, G., Yan, S., Zhang, C., Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), , Venice, Italy, 22 October 2017; Wang, K., Liu, Z., Lin, Y., Lin, J., Han, S., HAQ: Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), , Long Beach, CA, USA, 15–20 June 2019; Hinton, G., Vinyals, O., Dean, J., Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network (2015) arXiv, , 1503.02531; Bayram, F., Ahmed, B.S., Kassler, A., From Concept Drift to Model Degradation: An Overview on Performance-Aware Drift Detectors (2022) arXiv, , 2203.11070; Pau, D.P., Ambrose, P.K., Aymone, F.M., A Quantitative Review of Automated Neural Search and On-Device Learning for Tiny Devices (2023) Chips, 2, pp. 130-141; Dellaferrera, G., Kreiman, G., Error-driven Input Modulation: Solving the Credit Assignment Problem without a Backward Pass (2022) arXiv, , 2201.11665; Sanh, V., Debut, L., Chaumond, J., Wolf, T., DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: Smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter Proceedings of the NeurIPS EMC2 Workshop, , Vancouver, BC, Canada, 13 December 2019; Soltan, S., Ananthakrishnan, S., FitzGerald, J.G.M., Gupta, R., Hamza, W., Khan, H., Peris, C., Rumshisky, A., AlexaTM 20B: Few-shot learning using a large-scale multilingual seq2seq model (2022) arXiv, , 2208.01448; Rumelhart, D.E., Hinton, G.E., Williams, R.J., Learning representations by back-propagating errors (1986) Nature, 323, pp. 533-536; Pau, D.P., Aymone, F.M., Suitability of Forward-Forward and PEPITA Learning to MLCommons-Tiny benchmarks Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Omni-Layer Intelligent Systems (COINS), pp. 1-6. , Berlin, Germany, 23–25 July 2023; Ramachandran, P., Liu, P.J., Le, Q.V., Unsupervised Pretraining for Sequence to Sequence Learning (2016) arXiv, , 1611.02683; Dai, A.M., Le, Q.V., Semi-supervised sequence learning (2015) Adv.

Limitations arise from sensor-dependent data handling by manufacturers and user companies, hindering third-party access and comprehension. Initiatives like the European Data Act aim to enable high-quality access to sensor-generated data by regulating accuracy, completeness, and relevance while respecting intellectual property rights. Despite data availability, interoperability challenges impede sensor data reusability. For instance, sensor data shared in HTML formats requires an intricate, time-consuming processing to attain reusable formats like JSON or XML. This study introduces a methodology aimed at converting raw sensor data extracted from web portals into structured formats, thereby enhancing data reusability. The approach utilises large language models to derive structured formats from sensor data initially presented in non-interoperable formats. The effectiveness of these language models was assessed through quantitative and qualitative evaluations in a use case involving meteorological data. In the proposed experiments, GPT-4, the best performing LLM tested, demonstrated the feasibility of this methodology, achieving a precision of 93.51% and a recall of 85.33% in converting HTML to JSON/XML, thus confirming its potential in obtaining reusable sensor data. © 2024 by the authors.",data processing; data reusability; Internet of Things; interoperability; sensor data,Computational linguistics; HTML; Intellectual property; Internet of things; Interoperability; Laws and legislation; Reusability; Data availability; Data driven; Data reusability; Data volume; High quality; Intellectual property rights; Language model; Product and services; Sensors data; Third party access; Data handling; alanine aminotransferase; article; data availability; data processing; human; information processing; internet of things; language model; large language model; major clinical study; sensor,,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6",,,"PID2021-122263OB-C22, TED2021130890B-C21; Generalitat Valenciana, GVA; European Social Fund Plus, ESF: ACIF/2021/507; European Social Fund Plus, ESF","This research was funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union Next Generation EU/PRTR as part of the projects TED2021130890B-C21 and PID2021-122263OB-C22.

A large amount of quality-related data exists within and between processes, involving many types of quality defects and influencing factors. However, there are ambiguous causal associations among quality-related data affecting the shape-properties of the shell. Also, the coupling of long processes and multiple factors makes it hard to analyze the main factors that affect the quality defects in shell manufacturing. In this paper, taking into account the advantages of causal Scientology and the large language model (LLM), we propose an industrial structure causal knowledge-enhanced large language model for the cause analysis of quality defects in aerospace product manufacturing. To reinforce the causal associations among quality-related data deriving from manufacturing documents (product defect survey sheets, quality inspection, and maintenance reports), a structure causal graph-based sum-product network (SCG-SPN) model is designed to model machining quality-related knowledge and eliminate pseudo-association confounding factors by doing an intervention. Thus, a causal quality-related knowledge graph (CQKG) with high-quality causal associations is constructed. With this, to provide a trustworthy guarantee in responding to quality problem solving, we construct a quality-related prompt dataset with multi-round conversations based on CQKG. Then, a novel P-tuning that adapts to utilize external CQKG instructions is designed to fine-tune an open-source ChatGLM base model. Based on this, a causal knowledge graph-augmented LLM, named CausalKGPT, is developed to enable reasoning and responding to quality defects in both Chinese and English. It uses natural text descriptions related to quality defects as input and takes a quality-related causal knowledge graph as an additional corpus. Finally, the case study shows that the CausalKGPT performs with more expertise and reliability in responding to quality question solving of aerospace shell manufacturing than the classic commercial models like ChatGPT and GPT4. The results indicate that the proposed method may provide a trustworthy guide in assisting workers to analyze quality defects in aerospace products. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Aerospace product; Causal knowledge graph-guided prompt; Causal quality-related knowledge graph; Cause analysis of quality defects; Large language model,Computational linguistics; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Quality control; Shells (structures); Thin walled structures; Aerospace products; Causal knowledge graph-guided prompt; Causal quality-related knowledge graph; Cause analyse of quality defect; Causes analysis; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Quality defects; Defects,,,,,"CUSF-DH-D-2021043; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62202001; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM: 22YF1400200; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2019YFB1706300; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2019YFB1706300 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62202001 ), Shanghai Rising-Star Plan (Yangfan Program) from the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 22YF1400200 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University (No. CUSF-DH-D-2021043 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Zheng, P., Chen, C.-H., Shang, S., Towards an automatic engineering change management in smart product-service systems – A DSM-based learning approach (2019) Adv.

The recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful and promptable model for image segmentation that can produce high-quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes. However, recent studies have found that SAM, which is trained on natural images, performs poorly on non-natural images, such as industrial images, where the objects and backgrounds may have different characteristics and distributions. To address this problem, we propose Industrial-SAM, a SAM adapted for industrial vision applications. Industrial-SAM leverages the pre-trained SAM as a backbone and fine-tunes it on domain-specific datasets of industrial images. To efficiently train Industrial-SAM and make it suitable for industrial vision, we design an Interactive Adapter. Interactive Adapter is a novel module that can incorporate human feedback during training to guide the model learning. It can also generate adaptive prompts for different images based on their content and difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments on the cap welding segmentation dataset and seal pin welding segmentation dataset. The experimental results show that Industrial-SAM can train excellent industrial vision models with the help of human feedback. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Efficient Training; Human Interactive Learning; Industrial Segmentation; Segment-anything Models; Visual Adapter,Learning systems; Welding; Efficient training; Human interactive learning; Images segmentations; Industrial segmentation; Industrial segments; Industrial vision; Interactive learning; Natural images; Segment-anything model; Visual adapter; Image segmentation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, M., Seraj, R., Islam, S.M.S., The k-means algorithm: A comprehensive survey and performance evaluation (2020) Electronics, 9 (8), p. 1295; Chen, L.C., Papandreou, G., Kokkinos, I., Murphy, K., Yuille, A.L., DeepLab: Semantic image segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, atrous convolution, and fully connected CRFs (2017) IEEE Trans.

We propose a comprehensive framework that includes three core components: (1) matches manufacturing tasks with process parameters, emphasizing the challenges in LLM agents’ understanding of human-imposed constraints; (2) autonomously designs tool paths, highlighting the LLM agents’ proficiency in planar tasks and challenges in 3D spatial tasks; and (3) integrates embodied intelligence within industrial robotics simulations, showcasing the adaptability of LLM agents like GPT-4. Our experimental results underscore the distinctive performance of the GPT-4 agent, especially in Component 3, where it is outstanding in task planning and achieved a success rate of 81.88% across 10 samples in task completion. In conclusion, our study accentuates the transformative potential of LLM agents in industrial robotics and suggests specific avenues, such as visual semantic control and real-time feedback loops, for their enhancement. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Autonomous design; Decision-making; Embodied intelligence; Industrial robotics; Large language models (LLMs) agents,,,,,,"DE-EE0009726; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National University of Singapore, NUS",The two Ph.D. students Mr. Haolin Fan and Mr. Xuan Liu are supported by the National University of Singapore Chongqing Research Institute under the NUS Research Scholarship.

We propose a data-driven method for the prediction of control structures. Our methodology is inspired by end-to-end transformer-based human language translation models. We cast the control structure prediction as a translation task where Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) without control structures are translated to PFDs with control structures. We represent the topology of PFDs as strings using the SFILES 2.0 notation. We pretrain our model using generated PFDs to learn the grammatical structure. Thereafter, the model is fine-tuned leveraging transfer learning on real PFDs. The model achieved a top-5 accuracy of 74.8% on 10,000 generated PFDs and 89.2% on 100,000 generated PFDs. These promising results show great potential for AI-assisted process engineering. The tests on a dataset of 312 real PFDs indicate the need for a larger PFD dataset for industry applications and hybrid artificial intelligence solutions. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the design of high-fidelity digital scenes is challenging in that it often requires intensive manual processes and domain expertise to edit the 3D models or description documents. To reduce human efforts, this paper proposes ChatTwin, a conversational system that leverages the power of GPT-4 to automate the generation of scene description documents for digital twins. ChatTwin assists scene generation by i) segmenting user-input prompts, ii) generating scenes with segmented prompts, and iii) optimizing the generated content. Specifically, the Segment-and-Generate (SG) workflow decomposes the long-text generation into several subtasks and reduces the complexity of the original task. The evaluation through our data center digital twin system shows that ChatTwin outperforms other baselines in terms of generation accuracy and efficiency. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Automated Digital Twin; Data Center; Large Language Model,3d-modeling; Automated digital twin; Datacenter; Domain expertise; High-fidelity; Industrial fields; Language model; Large language model; Manual process; Physical systems; Computational linguistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chen, J., Zhu, W., Ali, M.M., A hybrid simulated annealing algorithm for nonslicing VLSI floorplanning (2010) IEEE Trans.

Companies actively gather behavioral information on their customers, recording multiple types of events, such as clicks, likes, page views, card transactions, add-to-basket, or purchase events. In response to this, the Synerise Monad platform has been proposed. The primary focus of Monad is to produce Universal Behavioral Representations (UBRs) - large vectors encapsulating the behavioral patterns of each user. UBRs do not lose knowledge about individual events, in contrast to aggregated features or averaged embeddings. They are based on award-winning algorithms developed at Synerise - Cleora and EMDE - and allow to process real-life datasets composed of billions of events in record time. In this paper, we introduce a new aspect of Monad: private foundation models for behavioral data, trained on top of UBRs. The foundation models are trained in purely self-supervised manner and allow to exploit general knowledge about human behavior, which proves especially useful when multiple downstream models must be trained and time constraints are tight, or when labeled data is scarce. Experimental results show that the Monad foundation models can reduce training time by half and require 3x less data to reach optimal results, often achieving state-of-the-art results. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",behavioral modeling; big data; foundation models; graph learning; representation learning,Behavioral research; Data mining; Foundations; Behavioral model; Behavioral patterns; Behavioral representation; Card transactions; Embeddings; Event-based; Foundation models; Graph learning; Real life datasets; Representation learning; Big data,,,,,"Narodowym Centrum Nauki, NCN; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Barbara Rychalska was supported by grant no 2018/31/N/ST6/02273 funded by National Science Centre, Poland.

Cognitive Assistants (CAs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5, can bridge knowledge gaps and improve worker performance in manufacturing settings. This study investigates the opportunities, risks, and user acceptance of LLM-powered CAs in two factory contexts: textile and detergent production. Several opportunities and risks are identified through a literature review, proof-of-concept implementation, and focus group sessions. Factory representatives raise concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the reliability of LLMs in high-stake environments. By following design guidelines regarding persistent memory, real-time data integration, security, privacy, and ethical concerns, LLM-powered CAs can become valuable assets in manufacturing settings and other industries. © 2023 Owner/Author.",cognitive assistant; conversational user interfaces; human-centered AI; industry 5.0; knowledge management; knowledge sharing,Computational linguistics; Data integration; Data privacy; User interfaces; Agile manufacturing; Cognitive assistant; Conversational user interface; Human-centered AI; Industry 5.0; Knowledge transfer; Knowledge-sharing; Language model; Security/privacy; Workers'; Knowledge management,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 957296; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020",This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program via the project COALA “COgnitive Assisted agile manufacturing for a LAbor force supported by trustworthy Artificial Intelligence” (Grant agreement 957296).,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Intelligent Cognitive Assistants: Workshop Summary and Recommendations, , https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/2016-1003-ICA-Workshop-Final-Report-2016.pdf; (2018) Intelligent Cognitive Assistants: Workshop Summary and Research Needs, , https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/ICA2-Workshop-Report-2018.pdf; Abner, B., Rabelo, R.J., Zambiasi, S.P., Romero, D., Production Management as-a-Service: A Softbot Approach (2020) Advances in Production Management Systems.

On one hand, testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorks' Simulink is important as a bug in the toolchain may propagate to the artifacts they produce. On the other hand, it is equally important to understand modeling practices and model evolution to support engineers and scientists as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification of CPS models. Existing work in this area is limited by two main factors, i.e., (1) inefficiencies of state-of-the-art testing schemes in finding critical tool-chain bugs and (2) the lack of a reusable corpus of public Simulink models. In my thesis, I propose to (1) curate a large reusable corpus of Simulink models to help understand modeling practices and model evolution and (2) leverage such a corpus with deep-learning based language models to test the toolchain. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Cyber-physical system development; deep learning; GPT-2; mining software repositories; model evolution; open-source; programming language modeling; Simulink; tool chain bugs,Accident prevention; Codes (symbols); Computational linguistics; Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Embedded systems; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Open source software; Open systems; Program debugging; Cybe-physical system development; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Deep learning; GPT-2; Mining software; Mining software repository; Model evolution; Open-source; Programming language models; Simulink; Software repositories; System development; Tool chain bug; Simulink,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1911017",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1911017 and a gift from MathWorks.,,,,,,,,,,"Bertram, V., Maoz, S., Oliver Ringert, J., Rumpe, B., Von Wenckstern, M., Component and Connector Views in Practice: An Experience Report (2017) MODELS, pp. 167-177. , IEEE Computer Society; Boll, A., Brokhausen, F., Amorim, T., Kehrer, T., Vogelsang, A., Characteristics, potentials, and limitations of open-source Simulink projects for empirical research (2021) SoSyM, pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-021-00883-0, 2021; Chen, Y., Groce, A., Zhang, C., Wong, W., Fern, X.Z., Eide, E., Regehr, J., Taming compiler fuzzers (2013) ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, PLDI '13, pp. 197-208. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2491956.2462173, Seattle, WA, USA, June 16-19, 2013; Azam Chowdhury, S., Mohian, S., Mehra, S., Gawsane, S., Johnson, T.T., Csallner, C., Automatically finding bugs in a commercial cyber-physical system development tool chain with SLforge (2018) Proc. 40th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE).

DeFACT is a framework of parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse where the Decentralized Autonomous Organization-based interactions between parallel workers consisting of robotic, digital, and human workers are elaborated to transform from professional division to real-virtual division. In DeFACT, human workers are only responsible for 5% physical and mental work that is complex and creative, and the robotic and digital workers can take care of the rest. The perceptual and cognitive intelligence of digital workers are intensified by a manufacturing foundation model (MF-PC), where calibration and certification (C&C), and verification and validation (V&V) guarantee not only the accuracy of task models, but also the interpretability and controllability of feature learning. As a case study, the workflow of customized shoes of SANBODY Technology Company is illustrated to show how DeFACT breaks the time and space constraints, avoids production waste caused by aesthetic discrepancies with consumers, and truly realizes flexible manufacturing. © 2013 IEEE.",and parallel execution (ACP); Artificial systems; computational experiments; cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs); decentralized autonomous organization (DAO); ManuVerse; parallel manufacturing; smart manufacturing,Engineering education; Flow control; Shoe manufacture; Uncertainty analysis; Virtual reality; And parallel execution (ACP); Artificial systems; Computational experiment; Cyber physicals; Cybe–physical–social system; Decentralised; Decentralized autonomous organization; Index; Manufacturing; Manuverse; Parallel executions; Parallel manufacturing; Smart manufacturing; Social systems; Robotics,,,,,"State Grid Corporation of China, SGCC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018AAA0101502; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018AAA0101502 and the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC): Fundamental Theory of Human-in-the-Loop Hybrid-Augmented Intelligence for Power Grid Dispatch and Control.,,,,,,,,,,"Leng, J., Blockchain-secured smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0: A survey (2021) IEEE Trans.

Typically, they contain hundreds of billions of hyperparameters that have been trained with hundreds of gigabytes of data. However, this type of black-box vulnerability places foundation models at risk of data poisoning attacks that are designed to pass on misinformation or purposely introduce machine bias. Moreover, ordinary researchers have not been able to completely participate due to the rise in deployment standards. This study introduces the theoretical framework of scenarios engineering (SE) for building accessible and reliable foundation models in metaverse, namely, 'SE-enabled foundation models in metaverse.' Particularly, the research framework comprises a six-layer architecture (infrastructure layer, operation layer, knowledge layer, intelligence layer, management layer, and interaction layer), which can provide controllability, trustworthiness, and interactivity for the foundation models in metaverse. This creates closed-loop, virtual-real, and human-machine environments that provides the best indices and goals for the foundation models, which allows us to fully validate and calibrate the corresponding models. Then, examples of use cases from the automotive industry are listed to provide transparency on the possible use and benefits of our approach.

Traditional industries heavily rely on human labor and neglect the development of collection-utilization-transmission integrated information loops, thereby leading to high costs and low efficiency in operational procedures. To facilitate the natural interactions and smart operations for humans and machines, industrial foundation models (IFMs) based on metaverses are proposed in this article, serving as the operating systems of industrial parallel machines that provide sustainable data resources and scenarios for management and control experiments. On this basis, IFM comprised of vision foundation models, language foundation models, as well as operational foundation models, are constructed to manage resources in industrial parallel machines and provides comprehensive services for industrial procedures. On the one hand, IFM can efficiently manage various resources including computing power, digital assets, enterprise resources, and platform I/O via the proposed CPSS-based competing, sharing, scheduling, monitoring, allocating, and recovering mechanisms. On the other hand, imaginative intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and algorithmic intelligence can be achieved through vivid visualization of vision foundation models, natural conversations of language foundation models, and smart manipulation of operational foundation models. With the proposed IFM, cyber-physical-social intelligence (CPSI) can be achieved to enhance the efficient management and control of industrial processes. © 2013 IEEE.",Cyber-physical-social intelligence (CPSI); cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs); industrial foundation models (IFMs); intelligent enterprises; metaverses; operational processes; parallel intelligence,Computing power; Foundations; Human resource management; Information management; Process control; Biological system modeling; Computational modelling; Cyber physicals; Cybe–physical–social intelligence; Cybe–physical–social system; Foundation models; Industrial foundation model; Intelligent enterprise; Metaverses; Operating system; Operational process; Parallel intelligence; Parallel machine; Social intelligence; Social systems; Task analysis; Parallel processing systems,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62103411; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62103411; and in part by the Motion G, Inc.

For the robot arm to effectively complete this task, it is necessary to obtain the pose information of the workpiece. Using a regular RGB camera, the workpiece to be captured is first segmented from the scene image; the segmented part is then used to obtain the pose information of the workpiece. In this paper, only the segmentation work is involved. Traditional image segmentation algorithms rely on human-designed features, which are often shallow and limited to specific image properties such as color and threshold. This results in suboptimal segmentation performance. Deep neural networks overcome this limitation by learning deep features from images that are more informative and discriminative; therefore, achieve more accurate segmentation results. To improve the detection performance of disordered mixed workpieces, YOLOv5 is enhanced with an attention mechanism to extract more features. The detection results are then transferred to the SAM model as prior information to segment each workpiece. Using binocular vision, we can obtain the depth information of each workpiece. We can then select the topmost workpiece with the smallest depth as the target to be captured and segment it from the scene image. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5 algorithm has an average accuracy of 1.6% higher than the original algorithm. Combined with the SAM model, the workpieces to be captured are segmented, and the segmentation accuracy is 2.6% higher than the original YOLOv5 and SAM models. © 2023 IEEE.",attention mechanism; image segmentation; robotic arm; SAM network; workpiece grabbing,Binocular vision; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Robotic arms; Stereo image processing; Assembly line; Attention mechanisms; Images segmentations; Manufacturing industries; Pose information; Robot arms; SAM network; Scene image; Workpiece; Workpiece grabbing; Image segmentation,,,,,XKY2212,This study was supported by the Science and Technology Program of University of Jinan under Grant XKY2212.,,,,,,,,,,"Xiangxiang, M., Biao, F., Lei, X., Hao, Y., Bo, Y., Kun, W., Research on robot arm motion control decision-making based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (2023) Computer Engineering and Applications, 59 (6), pp. 318-325; Nan, W., Xuewen, Y., A review of autonomous operation technology for vision-driven robotic arms (2021) Journal of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, 13 (3), p. 281; Xiaocui, Y., Lushen, W., Huawei, C., Rail image segmentation based on otsu method (2016) Optical Precision Engineering, 24 (7), p. 10; Lixia, L., Baowen, L., Yangping, W., Jingyu, Y., Improved canny edge detection for remote sensing image segmentation (2019) Computer Engineering and Applications, 55 (12), pp. 54-58; Ming, Z., Zhengwei, H., Product image detection based on improved faster rcnn and grabcut (2018) computer system appli-cations, 27 (11), p. 128; Fei, W., Liang, C., Xiaoguang, H., Changlei, R., Jinghong, L., Welding robot visual guidance based on weldment recognition and pose estimation (2020) Control and Decision-Making, 35 (8), pp. 1873-1878; Hui, Z., Kunfeng, W., Feiyue, W., Application progress and prospects of deep learning in target visual detection (2017) Journal of Automation, 43 (8), p. 17; Rajjak, S.S.A., Kureshi, A., Multiple-object detection and segmentation based on deep learning in high-resolution video using mask-rcnn (2021) International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 35 (13), p. 2150038; Youssouf, N., Traffic sign classification using cnn and detec-tion using faster-rcnn and yolov4 (2022) Heliyon, 8 (12); Chengjun, W., Zhiwen, W., Chen, Y., A review of research on sorting robots based on machine vision technology (2022) Science Technology and Engineering, 22 (3), pp. 893-902; Xueliang, W., Qiuju, Z., Design of automatic loading and unloading control system for manipulator based on plc (2012) Informatization of China's manufacturing industry, (8), pp. 59-62; Yongqiang, Z., Yuan, R., Shipeng, D., Ji, Z., A review of deep learning target detection methods. j (2020) Image Graph, 25 (4), pp. 629-654; Shengqiang, B., Research on machine vision technology of high speed robot sorting system based on deep learning (2021) 2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Aided Education (ICISCAE).

Engineering digital twins (DTs) is a complex process consisting of several phases and involving different disciplines. We argue that an investigation of LLM use in DTE has to define what kinds of DTs are in focus and what DTE phases shall be supported. In our work, we concentrate on the early phases of DTE, with a particular focus on requirements engineering (RE), and we focus on supervisory and operational DTs. This paper investigates the quality of LLM output for defining requirements for DTs.

This issue has attracted widespread attention, but there are few relevant benchmarks available. In this paper, we provide a benchmark Question Answering (QA) dataset named MSQA, centered around Microsoft products and IT technical problems encountered by customers. This dataset contains industry cloud-specific QA knowledge, an area not extensively covered in general LLMs, making it well-suited for evaluating methods aiming to enhance LLMs' domain-specific capabilities. In addition, we propose a new model interaction paradigm that can empower LLM to achieve better performance on domain-specific tasks where it is not proficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach following our method outperforms the commonly used LLM with retrieval methods.

Currently, the advancements in artificial intelligence have greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of IEOM. However, its robustness and generalization in practical applications still need to be improved. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have recently made breakthrough progress, demonstrating highly intelligent language comprehension capabilities. Therefore, they are expected to drive a new round of transformation in IEOM, promoting the automation and intelligence of the entire IEOM process. However, when using LLMs for practical industrial applications, existing LLMs have fatal limitations as they severely lack domain-specific expertise. This makes it difficult for LLMs to handle technical issues in the industrial field. To this end, this study explores a new solution: LLMs empowered by domain-specific knowledge base (LLM-DSKB). This paper provides a detailed introduction to the core components and implementation details of LLM-DSKB, including the knowledge base, text embedding, vectorized retrieval, etc. The performance of LLM-DSKB is analyzed using real industrial cases, and the results demonstrate that LLM-DSKB can provide more accurate, specific, and industrially relevant results compared to traditional LLMs. This solution will drive the application of LLMs in the industrial field, significantly enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of IEOM. © 2023 IEEE.",Domain-Specific Knowledge Base; Industrial Equipment Operations and Maintenance; Large Language Model,Computational linguistics; Condition based maintenance; Domain Knowledge; Efficiency; Repair; Domain-specific knowledge; Domain-specific knowledge base; Industrial equipment; Industrial equipment operation and maintenance; Industrial fields; Language model; Large language model; Normal operations; Operations and maintenance; Safe operation; Condition monitoring,,,,,"L191022; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71731008; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71731008) and the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation-Rail Transit Joint Research Program (L191022).

However, most studies focus on the application of sophisticated AI algorithms in maintenance optimization while overlooking how AI can directly assist maintenance and reliability (M&R) professionals in a more comprehensible manner. This study fills this gap by investigating the potential of language models, specifically the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models developed by OpenAI, in aiding M&R practitioners. We used the Certified Maintenance & Reliability Professional (CMRP) exam, accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to assess aptitude within 5 Pillars of the Society for Maintenance & Reliability Professionals Body of Knowledge, as a testing ground to evaluate and compare the performance and reasoning capabilities of the two AI models to that of human experts. Our findings suggest that while GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in providing self-consistent explanations and overall scoring, both models exhibited potential weaknesses, particularly in arithmetic operations and handling domain-specific terminologies. Despite these challenges, our results demonstrate the potential of these AI models as tools to support various M&R tasks, paving the way for more practical and comprehensive AI assistance in smart maintenance. © 2023 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence;

But obtaining large enough labelled data sets in Equipment Maintenance domain manually is prohibitive and very expensive. This lack of labeled Equipment Maintenance data can be overcome with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, BERT that are pretrained transformer networks, considered state-of-the-art when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the vocabulary understood by these LLMs are mostly from English Language and need to be fine-tuned to understand industry and organization specific vocabulary and acronyms. This paper explores the potential of a domain specific LLM model for oil and gas industries. Data that are of good quality and that provide a comprehensive overview of industry are collected. This corpus of text contains documents like work orders, equipment data and technical documents. A custom tokenizer is trained on this data to identify domain specific terminology. A comparative study is done with other off-the-shelf tokenizers: BERT and RoBERTa, to compare the effectiveness of the tokenization. With millions of work orders and equipment documents, training pipelines had to parallelized so that training can occur on multiple GPUs. A comprehensive study of multiple training methods is done in this paper. Model and tokenizer developed were packaged and archived to be consumed in machine learning pipelines to specific use-cases across the organization. For an organization adopting digital transformation, the availability of an organization specific LLM is an enabler to extract insights from millions of documents containing free text. The applicability of such models spans across multiple disciplines like Maintenance, Reliability, Safety etc. and streamlines the development of highly accurate and robust text analytics. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",Data Parallel; Distributed Data Parallel; Large Language Model; Masked Language Model; Natural Language Processing; RoBERTa; tokenization,Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Information retrieval systems; Maintenance; Natural language processing systems; Program processors; Speech recognition; Data parallel; Distributed data; Distributed data parallel; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Masked language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; RoBERTa; Tokenization; Pipelines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2023) PyTorch FSDP: Experiences on Scaling Fully Sharded Data Parallel; Lee, Jinhyuk, BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining (2020) Bioinformatics, 36 (4), pp. 1234-1240. , https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz682, and others, February Pages; Beltagy, Iz, Lo, Kyle, Cohan, Arman, SciBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Scientific Text (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pp. 3615-3620. , Hong Kong, China.

We retrofit the automation system for a modular production facility and create executable control interfaces of fine-granular functionalities and coarse-granular skills. Low-level functionalities are executed by automation components, and high-level skills are performed by automation modules. Subsequently, a digital twin system is developed, registering these interfaces and containing additional descriptive information about the production system. Based on the retrofitted automation system and the created digital twins, LLM-agents are designed to interpret descriptive information in the digital twins and control the physical system through service interfaces. These LLM-agents serve as intelligent agents on different levels within an automation system, enabling autonomous planning and control of flexible production. Given a task instruction as input, the LLM-agents orchestrate a sequence of atomic functionalities and skills to accomplish the task. We demonstrate how our implemented prototype can handle un-predefined tasks, plan a production process, and execute the operations. This research highlights the potential of integrating LLMs into industrial automation systems in the context of smart factory for more agile, flexible, and adaptive production processes, while it also underscores the critical insights and limitations for future work.

Software developers will be overwhelmed with the rise of Metaverse and game industry. Therefore, it is essential to fully automate the entire software development process with the help of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and advanced data analytics approaches. In this paper, we propose a new framework for automated solution development for smart grids that makes use of AI and advanced data analytics to address this challenge. Recent developments in AI technologies are used by our proposed framework to facilitate automated solution development. Our modular approach simplifies and expedites several phases of the software development process by building on the shortcomings of the current frameworks. To generate revenue, our suggested framework offers a number of business models from its adoption. We expect that our idea will inspire others to make unique contributions to the development of automated solution in smart grids to improve its operations and boost our economy. © 2023 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; data analytics; large language models; smart grid; Software development,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Computational linguistics; Data Analytics; Economics; Software design; Artificial intelligence technologies; Automated solutions; Data analytics; Language model; Large language model; Power; Self-healing; Smart grid; Software developer; Software development process; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Refaat, S.S., Ellabban, O., Bayhan, S., Abu-Rub, H., Blaabjerg, F., Begovic, M.M., Data Management in Smart Grid (2021) Smart Grid and Enabling Technologies, IEEE, pp. 249-269; Saleem, T.J., Chishti, M.A., Big Data Analytics for the Internet of Things (2021) Big Data Analytics for Internet of Things, pp. 1-5. , Wiley; Shahzad, K., Iqbal, S., A Reliable Graph-Based Routing Algorithm in Residential Multi-Microgrid Systems (2022) 19th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT), pp. 71-76. , Islamabad, Pakistan; Shafiq, S., Mashkoor, A., Mayr-Dorn, C., Egyed, A., A Literature Review of Using Machine Learning in Software Development Life Cycle Stages (2021) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 140896-140920; Alves, P.S., Goncalves, J.A., Basílio, J., Cadete, R.R., Ribeiro, P., Carvalho, J., Santos, C.F., Self-healing from theory to reality: The Portuguese case study (2021) 26th International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution, pp. 1298-1301; Dubey, A., Abhinav, K., Jain, S., Arora, V., Puttaveerana, A., HACO: A Framework for Developing Human-AI Teaming (2020) 13th Innovations in Software Engineering Conference on Formerly known as India Software Engineering Conference; Jüngling, S., Peraíc, M., Martin, A., Towards AI-based Solutions in the System Development Lifecycle (2020) AAAI Spring Symposium: Combining Machine Learning with Knowledge Engineering, pp. 1-6; Kaymakci, C., Wenninger, S., Sauer, A., A holistic framework for AI systems in Industrial Applications (2021) Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation, 47, pp. 78-93; William, P., Kumar, P., Chhabra, G.S., Vengatesan, K., Task Allocation in Distributed Agile Software Development using Machine Learning Approach (2021) 2021 International Conference on Disruptive Technologies for Multi-Disciplinary Research and Applications (CENTCON), pp. 168-172; Wu, H., Ma, Y., Xiang, Z., Yang, C., He, K., A spatial-temporal graph neural network framework for automated software bug triaging (2022) Knowledge-Based Systems, 241, p. 108308; Azzazi, A., Shkoukani, M., A knowledge-based expert system for supporting security in software engineering projects (2022) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 13 (1), pp. 395-400; Nguyen, N., Nadi, S., An Empirical Evaluation of GitHub Copilot's Code Suggestions (2022) 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 1-5",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"17th International Conference on Engineering of Modern Electric Systems, EMES 2023",9 June 2023 through 10 June 2023,,190633,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

To solve this problem, the transfer of skills to robots has been attracting much attention. However, they are not familiar with robot control, and hard to teach robots their skills by numerical commands or program source code. For more user-friendly human-robot interaction, a lot of studies have been conducted. In previous researches, robot task processes are pre-defined and not changed in task execution. We developed a robot system using the motion-copying system and GPT-3, one of the Large Language Models. This system can not only copy the motion but also modify saved motion in execution by using natural language commands. We evaluated the proposed system by applying it to polishing robots and confirmed that the surface of used workpieces was changed following to input commands. © 2023 IEEE.",human-robot interaction; large language models; motion control; motion reproduction system; natural language processing; polishing robot; robot teaching; transfer of skills,Cell proliferation; Computational linguistics; Man machine systems; Natural language processing systems; Polishing; Humans-robot interactions; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Motion reproduction system; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Polishing robots; Robot teaching; Transfer of skill; Human robot interaction,,,,,201603011,This work was partially supported by Strategic Information and Communications RandD Promotion Programme (SCOPE) Grant Number 201603011,This work was partially supported by Strategic Information and Communications R&D Promotion Programme (SCOPE) Grant Number 201603011.,,,,,,,,,"Nair, S., Mitchell, E., Chen, K., Savarese, S., Finn, C., Learning language-conditioned robot behavior from offline data and crowdsourced annotation (2022) Conference on Robot Learning.
